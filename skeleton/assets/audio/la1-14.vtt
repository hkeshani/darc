00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:09.580
The Great Mosque of Damascus in Syria, is the oldest surviving mosque, and is still being used today.

2
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:19.580
Completed around 716, the mosque features a vast sundrenched arcaded courtyard. Lavish decorations ornament the courtyard interior.

3
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.880
The arcade wall on the west includes an intriguing panel of glass and marble mosaics of a landscape.

4
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.500
Beautiful mosaics ornament the archways but the panel on the wall behind them is especially elaborate. 

5
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.940
It is a panorama of a landscape, perhaps real, perhaps imagined, or maybe both.

6
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.610
It includes monumental buildings and village-like groups of smaller buildings;

7
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.350
they are surrounded by oversized trees, regularly planted along a river that runs the length of the panel.

8
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.350
they are surrounded by oversized trees, regularly planted along a river that runs the length of the panel.

9
00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:01.260
The 10th century traveller and geographer al-Muqaddasi, who visited over 300 years after it was built wrote,

10
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.080
“The Mosque of Damascus is the fairest of any that the Muslims now hold ...

11
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:13.880
Even to the very ceiling are mosaics of various colors and in gold, showing figures of trees and towns”

12
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.430
The mosaics are made with cubes of coloured and gold leaf glass, marble and mother of pearl.

13
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:28.150
Green and blue are the favourite colours for the mosaic pieces, which are set against a shimmering gold background. 

14
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.030
The flowing river at the bottom spans across the entire panel.

15
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.750
Along the river banks, enormous trees grow dwarfing the cluster of buildings they surround.

16
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.970
Trees frame the next set of buildings, which include a large curved structure surrounding a grassy area.

17
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:55.290
Behind it are trees, a cluster of buildings with towers and still more trees. The scene is more landscaped than natural.

18
00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:06.350
A very large, symmetrical building appears next. On both ends of this section is a two-storey pillared building with a clam shell design.

19
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.490
Chains of pearls hang between the slender columns. Two gazebos side by side, with pitched roofs, are at the centre.

19
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:21.352
Large trees tower over the monument. The building is part of the landscape and the landscape is part of the building.

20
00:02:21.355 --> 00:02:24.720
The river beneath continues to flow.

21
00:02:24.967 --> 00:02:32.077
Further along, is a curious four-columned pavilion with a pitched roof. Vines twirl around the pillars.

22
00:02:32.078 --> 00:02:37.041
Very similar scenes are found in the famous ancient Roman city of Pompeii,

23
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.791
which means the mosaics of the Great Mosque of Damascus are part of a centuries-long, shared tradition of artmaking

24
00:02:44.792 --> 00:02:49.420
in the multicultural Ancient and early Medieval Mediterranean.

25
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.301
The end of the panel has more clusters of buildings. They may be palace complexes or townscapes.

26
00:02:57.301 --> 00:03:09.244
It’s hard to believe that this 37m long mosaic panel was hidden under whitewash for many years and only rediscovered in 1929, when the building was restored.

27
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.573
Who were the artists who made this elaborate mosaic and decorated other parts of the mosque?

28
00:03:16.574 --> 00:03:22.959
One tantalizing account from the mid 11th century says the Christian Byzantine emperor

29
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:32.900
sent 100,000 pieces of gold, 40 mule loads of mosaics and 1000 labourers, but this has been questioned.

30
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.345
Some say Egyptian mosaicists from Alexandria worked with Syrian artisans to make the mosaic.

31
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:51.302
Do the mosaics depict gardens or nature? Are the places real or imagined? Is it Damascus, a city which sits by the Barada river

32
00:03:51.303 --> 00:04:00.546
and was surrounded by gardens? Is it Alexandria by the Nile? Or, is it paradise as described in the Quran?

33
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:10.734
Whatever the case, the Landscape Panorama mosaic of the Great Mosque of Damascus continues to fascinate and inspire its many visitors.
