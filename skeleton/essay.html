    <summary>Introduction</summary>
  <div>
      <p>For centuries, the Vatican’s library in Italy has held a fascinating illustrated manuscript of the Arabic romance Bayad wa Riyad, which is thought to have been made in 13th C Spain, a time when Muslim rulers governed much of the Iberian peninsula. Surprisingly, it is the only illustrated Arabic manuscript to survive from Islamic Spain.</p>
  <p>This page is one of 30 surviving pages, 14 of which are illustrated. The scene depicts a group of 5 women and 2 men in a palace garden. Bordering the image are two rectangular yellow brick towers patterned with delicate line work that are consistent with the walled garden palace architecture of the time. They create a sense of a protected and hidden space, a visual sign of the importance of discretion. Just as the enclosing walls hide the party, so too must respectable people hide their feelings as the story being illustrated conveys. The beautiful women who have gathered in the palace garden drink wine while listening to a handsome merchant named Bayad play the oud, a forerunner of the lute. He sits on cushions at the right of the page, a group of beautiful slave women sit in the centre, and their mistress, who is being attended to by a male attendant, sits on an elevated platform on the left. The woman at the center of the image, whose face is unfortunately slightly worn due to the age of the manuscript is likely Riyad the object of Bayad’s affection. She stares fixedly at Bayad, while holding her cup. Drunk on love, Riyad is about to break the codes of propriety, and openly reveal her love for Bayad. </p>

  <summary>Muslims in Spain</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Muslims first arrived in the Iberian peninsula (Spain and Portugal) in the 8th century and established enduring multi-religious societies of Jews, Christians and Muslims for hundreds of years. Islamic Spain was called al-Andalus or Andalusia and Arabic was an important language of government and culture; modern Spanish and Portuguese acquired hundreds of Arabic words as a result (Corriente). The Muslim presence in Spain largely ended in the late 15th C, when Christian kings from the north took over the peninsula.

  <summary>The Story of Bayad and Riyad</summary>
  <div>
  <p>The Arabic romance story of Bayad and Riyad is about how the son of a merchant from Damascus, Syria named Bayad travels to Spain, sees a beautiful slavegirl named Riyad in a garden and falls in love with her at first sight. With the help of an old woman, he attends a gathering of women at the palace where Riyad lives and works, under the watchful eye of her mistress the Sayyida. Bayad sings passionate songs about Riyad, and she responds with song declaring her love for him. The public courtship creates a scandal, causing the Sayyida to end the gathering and the old lady to smuggle Bayad out of the palace dressed as a slavegirl (Robinson 1-3).

  <summary>Andalusian Gardens & Botany</summary>
  <div>
  <p>As shown in the Hadith Bayad wa Riyad manuscript, gardens were integral to Andalusian palaces. They were often separated into four quadrants, and the channels were used to irrigate the flowerbeds and orchards that made up these semi-private spaces (Ruggles 163). Beautiful gardens flourished alongside the rise in Arabic botanical science, which rested on ancient Greek foundations. Andalusia was important centre for the study of plant species and propagation, fruit tree cultivation, plant diseases, and pharmacology, making lasting contributions to Medieval science (Hitti 574-576).

  <summary>Calligraphy</summary>
  <div>
  <p>A key characteristic of calligraphy from al-Andalusia is the use of semi-circular loops and curving lines (Khemir 115). These stylistic differences helped modern scholars to identify Spain as the Hadith Bayad wa Riyad manuscript’s place of production. Calligraphy is one of the most valued form of art in the Islamic world and has the status of a fine art. Because of its artistic importance, there are many different schools of calligraphy across the Islamic world.

  <summary>Slavery</summary>
  <div>
  <p>The Mediterranean slave trade and institutions of which Spain was a part of dates back to pre-Islamic period, and continued under Muslim and Christian rule until the 16th century. Mediterranean slavery was superseded by the European Transatlantic Slave trade from the 16th to the 19th century. Slaves could occupy many roles in the medieval Spain and the rest of the Islamic world. They worked as domestic servants, skilled labourers, field-hands, and military soldiers, to name a few. In contrast to the trans-Atlantic slave-trade in the Americas, there were arguably somewhat more opportunities for slaves to become free, or to obtain power (de la Puente 580).

</p>
  <p>Gender played an important role in Mediterranean slavery, and women like Riyad, were most often domestic servants or concubines, desired for their appearance and skill as entertainers (Hourani 116). Notably, all of the young women depicted in Hadith Bayad wa Riyad are represented as conventionally beautiful, with black hair and large eyes; additionally, they are all skilled musicians, and singers who perform in the story (Soller 14). Riyad, as a particularly beautiful and talented slave, is the Sayyida’s favorite attendant and the Sayyida longs for Riyad’s happiness. However, because Riyad is desired by the Sayyida’s father, her happiness and ability to make choices is always constrained. The dilemma that Riyad finds herself in shows the medieval Islamic world’s ambivalence towards slavery. Seen as logistical necessity, it was at the same time seen as something to avoid, as freeing one’s slaves was a mark of higher moral behavior (Hourani 116).

  <summary>Drinking Wine</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Wine-drinking features prominently the story Bayad and Riyad, in which the principal characters are Muslims in Islamic Spain. Although Muslims generally believe the truly faithful should not consume alcohol, making and drinking wine was popular in many regions including Spain (Matthee).

  <summary>The <em>Oud</em></summary>
  <div>
  <p>The oud is a stringed instrument that is the ancestor to the guitar (Doak 104). Oud or al-ud means wood in Arabic and this instrument was an important part of Arabic musical culture well before the arrival of Islam. The oud could be used to play instrumental pieces or be used to support poetry that was sung. The links between the structures of Arabic poetry and music are well documented. Traditional Arabic music uses a system of modes, stylistic or rhythmic conventions that are used to create a specific emotion in the listener. These musical frameworks are related to poetry through their use of similar structures of rhythm and phrase length (Fass 532).

</p>
  <p>Music and poetry  are central to Hadith Bayad wa Riyad and there is little distinction between the two forms. The modes or moods of both poetry and music also have a powerful effect on the listener. Riyad, for instance, is so moved by Bayad’s words that she forgets the importance of public modesty which shows the importance of poetry in Arabic cultures.

</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Cross-cultural Significance</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Recent scholarship on Hadith Bayad wa Riyad links it to both the Islamic world and the better known Christian tradition of medieval romances. These authors argue that ideas of chaste love, extreme devotion and courtly culture which were part of the Islamic context from the early 9th century migrated to Europe through Islamic Spain (Robinson 3). This is significant because of the way that it emphasizes the cross-cultural nature of poetry and literature in the al-Andalusian context. Instead of seeing Muslim Spain as separate, Islamic cultural production is arguably integral to what is commonly thought of as European history.
