00:00:00.00 --> 00:00:8.59
In this particular story from the tutinama, the parrot tries to steer Khujasta away from

2
00:00:08.60 --> 00:00:12.25
meeting the man that she is attracted to using the story of Bashir and Chunder.

3
00:00:12.26 --> 00:00:20.61
Bashir had formed an intimacy with a woman named Chunder who was in a predicament.

4
00:00:20.62 --> 00:00:24.76
not too dissimilar to that of khujasta. The parrot's storytelling intentions were based out of

5
00:00:24.77 --> 00:00:29.00
fear for his own life. However, it can be assumed that he had also feared

6
00:00:29.01 --> 00:00:35.13
for Khujasta's life for at the time during the Mughal period, while men got away

7
00:00:35.14 --> 00:00:41.40
with extra-marital affairs, women were flogged and beheaded for their crimes. In

8
00:00:41.41 --> 00:00:47.83
this first image, the parrot in the bird cage pours cold water over Khujasta's flames

9
00:00:47.84 --> 00:00:55.03
of lust and love by intriguing her with a snippet of the story. An irony

10
00:00:55.04 --> 00:00:59.58
of power is displayed. Khujasta's nobility and gestures showcase the power that come's with it.

11
00:00:59.59 --> 00:01:05.39
Meanwhile, the bird is in a cage bereft of freedom and the same kind of

12
00:01:05.40 --> 00:01:12.19
power. However, in the context of the story, the true power seems to lie with

13
00:01:12.20 --> 00:01:16.40
the parrot as it seems to have the ability to manipulate Khujasta and make her

14
00:00:76.41 --> 00:00:81.08
listen to his advice. It represents the power over mind and physicality and status.

15
00:00:81.09 --> 00:00:90.81
In this image, Bashir and Chunder's affair becomes publically known. Thus, bashir kept away from

16
00:00:90.82 --> 00:00:96.82
her and this caused him great distress. In this distress, Bashir confides to an arab friend,

17
00:00:96.83 --> 00:00:103.49
who he had once been intimate with of his sorry and asks for his help

18
00:00:103:50 --> 00:00:109.33
to meet Chunder. The upper quarter of the picture showcases bashir asking for the arab's help.

19
00:00:109:34 --> 00:00:116.07
while the lower part of the image showcases Chunder describing her plan to bashir and Chunder.

20
00:00:116:08 --> 00:00:124.42
with regards to their escapade. Zooming in on the upper quarter, one can notice the

21
00:00:124.43 --> 00:00:129.61
blushing gaze that graces Bashir during this plea of help. It is also noticeable how

22
00:00:129.62 --> 00:00:135.00
Bashir's face showcases a certain level of confidence, this is interesting as it showcases

23
00:00:135.01 --> 00:00:141.82
how individuals use vulnerability as a way to manipulate others and help them complete a

24
00:00:141.82--> 00:00:147.80
particular task that may jeopardize their well-being. Zooming in on the lower quarter,

25
00:00:147.81 --> 00:00:155.50
The plan being concocted is shown. The Arab was to take the place of Chunder in her house,

26
00:00:155.51 --> 00:00:160.70
in her gown, at night when her husband comes to give her milk. He was instructed to

27
00:00:160.71 --> 00:00:167.9
not speak and only drink the milk offered once the husband left. While this exchange was

28
00:00:167.91 --> 00:00:174.10
taking place, Chunder would meet Bashir underneath the tree decided upon. This image

29
00:00:174.11 --> 00:00:181.73
shows the intimacy of Chunder and Bashir while an overview of the chambers in which the

30
00:00:181.74 --> 00:00:189.80
Arab was to go to is shown on the bottom half. However, the plan meandered

31
00:00:189.81 --> 00:00:195.88
into Chunder's husband flogging the Arab in Chunder's disguise due to her being indulged

32
00:00:197.88 --> 00:00:200:00
by him and her not providing him with the intimacy that she was engaging in

33
00:00:200.01 --> 00:00:208.01
with Bashir. He states "Notwithstanding I Shew you so much indulgence, you will not open

34
00:00:208.02 --> 00:00:212.64
your lips, nor give any answer to my words”. The story continues with the husband leaving

35
00:00:212.65 --> 00:00:219.43
the Arab in this battered state, AT this point, Chunder's sister walks into her chambers

36
00:00:219.44 --> 00:00:225.05
and the Arab reveals the scenario upon which he had fallen into. He begs her not reveal

37
00:00:225.06 --> 00:00:231.68
this knowledge to anyone as it would be detrimental to all parties involved. She feels

38
00:00:231.69 --> 00:00:238.38
for him and eventually decides to sleep with him. In this image, Chunder consoles the

39
00:00:238.39 --> 00:00:245.82
Arab due to her grief upon hearing the information regarding the Arab's flogging bereft

40
00:00:245.83 --> 00:00:252.15
of the knowledge that he had been pleasured by Chunder's sister. An interesting observation from

41
00:00:252.16 --> 00:00:258.85
the story is that Khujasta is more tempted to go upon hearing the story presumably due to the

42
00:00:258.86 --> 00:00:264.76
happy conclusions for most of the characters involved. The story ends with the parrot

43
00:00:264.77--> 00:00:268.77
asking Khujasta to leave for her lover but by then it was morning and her meeting with

44
00:00:264.78--> 00:00:280.00
her lover was delayed. Thank you
