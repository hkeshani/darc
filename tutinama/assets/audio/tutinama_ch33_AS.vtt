Under Emperor Akbar’s instructions, 52 miniature illustrations were made for each short story by two artists named Mir Sayyid Ali and Abdus Samad.

In 1801, a lexicographer named Francis Gladwin translated the text into English.

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
The tale starts off with the emperor of China dreaming about an unknown queen and becoming intoxicated by her beauty and the mystery behind her identity.

5
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
He commands his vizier to paint her portrait and ask travellers passing by if they recognize her.

6
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
The vizier comes across a traveller who informed him that she is the Queen of Rum and recounts the story of why she refuses to take a husband.

7
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
On the tree was nest of eggs guarded by a hen and a peacock.
Once lit with fire, the Queen closely watched.

8
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
The hen stayed with her eggs and perished with her nest, while the peacock flew away to safety.

9
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
This shocked the Queen as it represented the faithlessness of men.

10
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
After finally finding out who the women in the portrait was, the vizier informs the Emperor about the Queen of Rum.

11
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
However, the Emperor is still adamant on winning the affections of the Queen, despite her perversion about men.

12
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
So, they came up with a plan to send the Vizier to the Queen of Rum’s court as an official painter.

13
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
The Queen hires the vizier to make paintings for her court.

14
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
Little did the Queen know, the vizier was conspiring by making the same portrait of the Emperor of China over and over again.

15
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
This leads the Queen to get infatuated by the man in the portraits.

16
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
The vizier tells the Queen a story that is a replication of her own.

17
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
Telling her that the Emperor has refused the company of women.

18
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
The Emperor sits atop his balcony and looks out into the wild, he witnesses the river overflowing.

19
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
A passage from Gladwin’s translation describes the scene which unfolded before the Emperor,

20
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
it states, “suddenly, the river overflowed its banks, when the doe, not having resolution to face the water, separated herself … the buck, having more natural affection staid there with the fawn and was drowned.”

21
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
Upon hearing this, the Queen was amazed with the Emperor due to their similar experiences.

22
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
The Queen said to the vizier “the Emperor’s case is parallel to mine” and asked for a union.

23
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
By the next day, an ambassador was sent to the Emperor of China who offered the consent to marry the Queen of Rum.

24
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
Resulting in the marriage between the Emperor and Queen.

25
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
Persian interpterion of Indian texts led to a beautiful compilation of two unique and distinct styles which is evident in the Tutinama.

26
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
By blending in Indian and Iranian styles, the manuscript was a huge success.

27
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
One of the artists praised for his ability to bring naturalism to objects, which was unknown to South Asian art and is strongly present in this short story.
