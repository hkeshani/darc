00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
The Tuti-namah, or “Tales of a Parrot,” was one of the first manuscripts commissioned by the famous

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:14.100
Mughal Emperor of the 16th century, Akbar. Influenced by Indian, Persian and Islamic styles, these illustrations

3
00:00:14.100--> 00:00:18.500
depict the stories told by a parrot to a woman named Khojisteh, who needed to be kept

4
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.800
distracted from visiting a handsome, foreign prince and betraying her travelling husband, Meimun.

5
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.500
One night as Khojisteh went to leave to meet her lover, she saw the parrot sitting pensively. Curious as to

6
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.200
what he was thinking, Khojisteh asked the parrot what was on his mind. The parrot explained to her that

7
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.000
he hopes she gets the chance to visit her lover before her husband returns and it’s too late.

8
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.700
The parrot continued on to say that he does not want her to regret missing out on meeting the prince, like

9
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:55.500
“the cat, who, after the death of the mice, repented.” Khojisteh, curious as to how a cat could repent

10
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
killing mice, wanted to hear more about this story from the parrot. The parrot began to tell the story

11
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.500
of an old, weary lion. The lion is depicted as a tiger in the illustration due to the interchangeability

12
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:17.000
of the Hindu word “shir”, which is used for big cat animals. This lion was so old that his teeth were

13
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.500
rotten, and when he ate meat, it would stick in between his teeth. Every night, while the lion was

14
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.500
sleeping, mice would appear and pick at the lion’s teeth to get the leftover scraps of meat, disturbing

15
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:37.500
him from his sound sleep. After many frustrating nights, the lion asked his companions for advice on

16
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:45.000
what to do about these disturbing mice. A fox came forward, and stated he had a grand idea for the lion.

17
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.500
Intrigued and weakened by age and fatigue, the lion laid patiently with his eyes widened, listening to

18
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.500
the fox’s advice. He suggested that the lion should order the cat to keep watch over him at night to

19
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.500
scare off the mice. Fortunately, this worked great for the lion and the cat; the lion was no longer

20
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.000
disturbed by the mice and the cat was repaid with a good wage and a comfortable home. The cat, smart as

21
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.500
she was, knew to only scare off the mice, not to kill them. If she were to kill all the mice, the lion

22
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:27.500
would no longer have use for her services, leaving her jobless and homeless. One day, the cat brought

23
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.000
her strong kitten to work to protect the old, withering lion as she wished to leave town for business.

24
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.500
When the mice came out that night, the large kitten quickly pounced and, like a scene from a horror

25
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:48.500
movie, massacred all the mice in one swift, calculated movement. Arriving upon the massacre, the cat was

26
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.000
furious at her kitten, “What have you done? Why have you killed all the mice?!” The kitten responded,

27
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
“Why did not you speak to me at the time of your departure, and forbid me to kill the mice?” In the end,

28
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.200
both the cat and kitten repented. The lion excused the cat from her services, leaving her and her kitten

29
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.500
with no money and no home. Upon finishing the story, the parrot admitted to Khojisteh that she appears

30
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.000
very backward to him, since every day she delays her visit to her lover, while the parrot is afraid her

31
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.500
husband should return and she would repent not going to meet him, like the cat. He tells her this story

32
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.000
in order to stay alive and to make her believe that she will regret not visiting her lover, when in

33
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
reality the parrot is trying to delay her from breaking her vows with her husband. Convinced by the

34
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.200
parrot to go visit her lover, Khojisteh turned to leave, when she caught sight of daylight, and once

35
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.000
again, “deferred” her visit.
