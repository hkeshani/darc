00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920
The Tutinama or, the Tales of the Parrot, is a collection of short tales with moral lessons focused

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.500
towards the lonely protagonist Khojisteh. The manuscript was commissioned by the Mughal King Akbar

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:18.233
in the 16th century, as he was greatly interested in literature and the arts. Akbar’s love for all

4
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.092
things art expanded the artistic style of the time to include the art of Islamic, Persian, Central

5
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.742
Asian, and Indigenous Indian cultures. Early examples of this overlapping is observable in the

6
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.719
Tutinama. Various artists from different cultural backgrounds were hired to create the beautiful

7
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.000
illustrations that accompanied the tales, each bringing a unique style to the manuscript. These

8
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.903
illustrated stories are told from the perspective of a wise parrot, who attempts to prevent

9
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.620
Khojisteh from being unfaithful with her lover while her husband is away. In the Twentieth Tale of

10
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.800
the Tuti-Nama titled “The Woman who by a Stratagem escaped out of the Lion's clutches” we see the

11
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.276
parrot tell a tale to Khojisteh of a woman who uses wit to outmaneuver a dangerous leopard.

12
00:01:01.492 --> 00:01:06.362
The translation of the original text has lead to some discrepancies such as referring to the animal in

13
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.348
the story as a “lion” when in fact the animal is illustrated as a leopard. The story begins with

14
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.407
the setting of the sun, and the rise of the moon when Khojisteh yet again plans to meet her lover.

15
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.142
Before she leaves, she asks the parrot for permission to go, and to give it to her quickly so she

16
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.500
won’t miss her opportunity to see her lover again. In response the parrot claims that Khojisteh is

17
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.731
wise and does not need to seek his permission or guidance. Yet, the parrot tells her that if she is

18
00:01:30.731 --> 00:01:35.672
to run into trouble while on her adventure to put into practice wit like the woman who escaped the leopard.

19
00:01:36.252 --> 00:01:41.520
Intrigued, Khojisteh asks “what kind of story is that?” again getting distracted by the

20
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.506
parrot’s tales. The parrot begins the tale of a woman who flees her home with her two small

21
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.150
children after being physically abused by her husband. They safely flee into a forest filled with

22
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.740
animated and alluring foliage and colours, until they encounter a fierce leopard. The threat of the

23
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.445
wild cats hunger is seen in its sinister eyes, long tongue, and sharp teeth. Frightened, the woman

24
00:02:05.465 --> 00:02:09.986
thinks to herself that if she and her children escape the clutches of the leopard without harm then

25
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.288
she will “return home and be obedient to [her husband]”. Thinking on her feet, she materializes a

26
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.145
story in hopes that it will protect her children and herself. With confidence, she entices the

27
00:02:21.165 --> 00:02:26.363
leopard to listen to her words. She exclaims that in these woods there roams a mighty beast that

28
00:02:26.383 --> 00:02:32.575
every man and animal fears. Everyday, the king will send subjects into the forest to be devoured by

29
00:02:32.595 --> 00:02:39.367
the beast, and today is her and her children’s turn. The woman continues by offering her children

30
00:02:39.387 --> 00:02:44.018
to the leopard in exchange for her freedom, claiming that she will be unburdened and able to

31
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.916
escape. The leopard, only being occupied by two small infants will also have the opportunity to

32
00:02:50.936 --> 00:02:57.274
escape before the beast arrives. The leopard responds, claiming that since he has nowhere to escape

33
00:02:57.294 --> 00:03:03.388
to, there is no point in devouring her children, and leaves them unharmed. Her plan having worked,

34
00:03:03.408 --> 00:03:06.225
the mother is able to escape and goes back to her husband.

35
00:03:07.491 --> 00:03:13.455
Having completed his story, the parrot tells Khojisteh to now go to her lover. However, as

36
00:03:13.475 --> 00:03:18.718
Khojisteh makes to leave, the cock crows signalling the rise of the sun and end of the night, again

37
00:03:18.738 --> 00:03:24.395
deterring Khojisteh’s plan to meet her lover. The story the parrot tells works not only as a

38
00:03:24.415 --> 00:03:30.698
distraction to Khojisteh, but also provides a moral lesson. The woman in the story runs away from

39
00:03:30.718 --> 00:03:36.299
her husband, but upon coming into danger, promises to remain faithful if she is able to escape.

40
00:03:36.895 --> 00:03:42.710
The parrot, as a means of discouraging Khojisteh from being unfaithful, uses this to remind her to

41
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.350
remain loyal to her husband.
