00:01.000 --> 00:04.500
<v Tony Yu>Hey, Hi, Hello! I hope everyone had fun on this research assignment!

00:04.500 --> 00:07.800
<v Tony Yu>I’m sure I did! I believe what we’re doing here is shedding light

00:07.800 --> 00:10.500
<v Tony Yu>onto a time in history that isn’t discussed in our everyday

00:10.500 --> 00:14.000
<v Tony Yu>and I think that’s great… Before we begin this tale

00:14.000 --> 00:17.400
<v Tony Yu>of how a man stuck a snake in his sleeve, we must first talk about

00:17.400 --> 00:21.400
<v Tony Yu>the rich context that encapsulates this oh so captivating tale.

00:21.400 --> 00:27.000
<v Tony Yu>This story is part of a series of 52 stories that have two predominant figures

00:27.400 --> 00:33.500
<v Tony Yu>throughout: The Parrot and Khojisteh. Khojisteh seeks her husband who is away and the Parrot’s

00:33.500 --> 00:37.500
<v Tony Yu>one job is to tell her almost riddle-like stories that are jam packed with moralistic

00:37.500 --> 00:44.200
<v Tony Yu>innuendos that prevent Khojisteh from being a “ho”. Basically, Khojisteh is just a bag of

00:44.200 --> 00:55.000
<v Tony Yu>horn-dogs while the Parrot so entertainingly directs her attention from one bird specie to

00:55.000 --> 00:56.900
<v Tony Yu>another. Fun fact: there’s actually an illustrated version containing 250 paintings that was commissioned by

00:56.900 --> 01:02.100
<v Tony Yu>his son, Akbar?! Talk about daddy issues… Now that you vaguely know the context of

01:02.100 --> 01:07.500
<v Tony Yu>the stories in its rawest form, it’s story time. This story is set on the

01:07.500 --> 01:17.000
<v Tony Yu>service of a snake. The Parrot tells a tale of the “Nobleman and the Snake.”

01:17.000 --> 01:20.800
<v Tony Yu>The snake tells the Nobleman that there is a man after it and that it

01:20.800 --> 01:26.100
<v Tony Yu>needs protection. The kind Nobleman allows the snake to enter his sleeve for protection. Although

01:26.100 --> 01:29.100
<v Tony Yu>we don’t directly see it on the image, but we can infer that there is

01:29.100 --> 01:34.200
<v Tony Yu>a confrontation here. Right off the bat, we can tell it’s from Akbar’s time besides

01:34.200 --> 01:39.100
<v Tony Yu>the obvious, in a more artistic sense it adheres to the 16th century styles of

01:39.100 --> 01:44.400
<v Tony Yu>realism and naturalism as we can see with the Nobleman-like figure and an exact

01:44.400 --> 01:50.000
<v Tony Yu>replica of a snake. Their colorful surroundings can be amicable to realism and naturalism

01:50.000 --> 01:59.000
<v Tony Yu>style as well.A more in depth look into the image here we can infer

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
<v Tony Yu>that the snake is asking something of the Nobleman. The two figures are in total eye

02:03.000 --> 02:08.400
<v Tony Yu>contact. The Nobleman’s stance suggests that he’s listening to the snake. His hands are positioned

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
<v Tony Yu>right below the waist and are holding one another. Although different, this reminds me of

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
<v Tony Yu>the Mona Lisa. This position is actually reminiscent of Asian Just by the way his

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
<v Tony Yu>hands are and the expression on his face. Tony! How can you tell that this

02:22.000 --> 02:26.400
<v Tony Yu>figure is the Nobleman? You may ask and that’s simple! He’s the only humanoid figure

02:26.400 --> 02:31.500
<v Tony Yu>within the image. But on a more serious note, his garments suggests silk and we

02:31.500 --> 02:36.100
<v Tony Yu>all know how boujee silk is right? I mean, to call that fit a “hunting

02:36.100 --> 02:41.100
<v Tony Yu>outfit” is literally spitting on the face of Mughal fashion. The garments seen on the

02:41.100 --> 02:45.000
<v Tony Yu>Nobleman besides what we know from the story suggests that he is of high ranking

02:45.000 --> 02:52.200
<v Tony Yu>power. The use of color orange may also suggest courage or sacrifice. In Hinduism, it

02:52.200 --> 02:57.000
<v Tony Yu>is believed that the color orange represents  the “Sacral Chakra!” So in a way the

02:57.000 --> 03:03.500
<v Tony Yu>artist may be paying homage to a divine figure, perhaps Krishna? The background is ripped

03:03.500 --> 03:12.500
<v Tony Yu>the snake and the Nobleman’s surroundings suggest that they are out in the wilderness. The

03:12.500 --> 03:19.000
<v Tony Yu>lack of man made architecture support this claim.This is the next image for the

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
<v Tony Yu>story. According to the text, this falls under the Forty-Fifth night: The amir slays

03:25.000 --> 03:31.000
<v Tony Yu>the snake after giving it shelter. The ending is pretty explanatory here. The Nobleman is

03:31.000 --> 03:35.500
<v Tony Yu>confronted by the snake’s pursuant and tells him that the snake has fled. After the

03:35.000 --> 03:39.500
<v Tony Yu>coast is cleared the Nobleman tells the snake that his pursuant has left but the

03:39.500 --> 03:44.500
<v Tony Yu>snake then threatens the Nobleman saying that the Nobleman is a “fool for giving compassion

03:44.500 --> 03:49.000
<v Tony Yu>to an enemy for his kind! The Nobleman ponders on what to do for a

03:49.500 --> 03:54.300
<v Tony Yu>moment then tells the snake that another one of its species has come and the Snake peeks out of the

03:54.300 --> 03:58.500
<v Tony Yu>man’s sleeve. The Nobleman man tricks the snake and strikes it with a stone and

03:58.500 --> 04:04.000
<v Tony Yu>kills it. I guess, the moral of the story is to never trust talking animals.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
<v Tony Yu>Or for Khojisteh, do not mistake who your enemies are and I guess also the

04:09.000 --> 04:16.000
<v Tony Yu>idea of lust. Also it’s worth mentioning the artistic style of this piece, compared to

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
<v Tony Yu>the last image, the Nobleman’s eyes grew bigger and he has a full on beard

04:20.000 --> 04:27.500
<v Tony Yu>now. It seems that he’s acquired a Horse too.A closer look at the image

04:27.500 --> 04:33.800
<v Tony Yu>shows that unlike the first image, there is a chronological order of how the story

04:33.800 --> 04:38.000
<v Tony Yu>unfolds, from top to bottom.From the top-side of the image we can see

04:38.000 --> 04:45.700
<v Tony Yu>the confrontation between the Nobleman and the Snake’s pursuant. Their body language suggests that they

04:45.700 --> 04:51.000
<v Tony Yu>are communicating with each other. Their hand gestures suggest that both figures are respecting

04:51.000 --> 04:55.500
<v Tony Yu>one another. This stems from their use of an open-palm gesture rather than just

04:55.500 --> 04:59.500
<v Tony Yu>pointing with their index fingers. We can even go as far as to observe the

04:59.500 --> 05:04.500
<v Tony Yu>two figure’s relation to power. Since the Nobleman’s position within the image is higher than

05:04.500 --> 05:09.000
<v Tony Yu>that of the Snake’s pursuant, we can infer that the pursuant is of lower social

05:09.000 --> 05:15.500
<v Tony Yu>class than the Nobleman. Fun fact: The Triangle thing you see strapped on their waist

05:15.500 --> 05:21.500
<v Tony Yu>is a dagger from the “Ain-i Akbari” weaponry. These weapons were prominent not only in

05:21.500 --> 05:28.500
<v Tony Yu>Akbar’s times but also during Babur’s as well! From the top section of the image,

05:28.500 --> 05:32.000
<v Tony Yu>we can infer that this is the place in time where the two humans of

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
<v Tony Yu>the story meet. Let me direct your attention to the bottom section of the image.

05:37.000 --> 05:43.000
<v Tony Yu>We see that the Nobleman has killed the snake. However, we see no indicator that

05:43.000 --> 05:49.000
<v Tony Yu>the Nobleman used a stone like the text suggests. We do see blood coming out

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
<v Tony Yu>of the snake’s mouth which suggests that he’s killed the snake. At first glance, I

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
<v Tony Yu>thought the Nobleman’s expression was kind of comical. The finger on his mouth triggers a

05:59.000 --> 06:04.500
<v Tony Yu>kind of youthful “oops” feeling. Maybe like a small child curious as to what his

06:04.500 --> 06:10.200
<v Tony Yu>actions will entail, kills the snake and goes “woops, I guess that’s what that does.”

06:10.200 --> 06:19.000
<v Tony Yu>The surroundings suggests again they’re still outdoors from the rock that the Nobleman’s perched upon

06:19.200 --> 06:25.000
<v Tony Yu>and the lack of man-made architecture suggests this. If I may direct your attention

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
<v Tony Yu>back to the Snake’s pursuant and the Nobleman. Their facial hair is different too. The

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
<v Tony Yu>snake’s pursuant has a longer beard than the Nobleman. Maybe this suggests he’s from a

06:35.000 --> 06:39.500
<v Tony Yu>different region due to genetic differences or maybe this has something to do with one’s

06:39.500 --> 06:44.500
<v Tony Yu>social structure. The horse on the other hand is just as convoluting for me as

06:44.500 --> 06:48.000
<v Tony Yu>is you. I have to mention that this might be an ode from the artist

06:48.500 --> 06:55.000
<v Tony Yu>himself. To differentiate between the Nobleman and the snake’s pursuant, the horse in this situation

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
<v Tony Yu>may be linked to the Nobleman with its lavish accessories to compliment the Nobleman’s high

07:00.000 --> 07:08.300
<v Tony Yu>rank power.Alright, now that we’ve discussed both images, do you see the correlational link

07:08.300 --> 07:13.000
<v Tony Yu>between the two and in relation to the text? The story may be vaguely translated

07:13.000 --> 07:17.500
<v Tony Yu>and even lost within the images but once you’re familiar with the text it becomes

07:17.500 --> 07:22.000
<v Tony Yu>quite apparent to the mind. Thank you!
