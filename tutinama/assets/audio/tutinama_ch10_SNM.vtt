00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.430
Khojisteh the main character of the Tutinama and the merchant's daughter yet again goes to the  

2
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:14.780
Parrot to listen to another mesmerizing story. The Parrot agrees and tells Khojisteh an 

3
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.550
extraordinary story to keep her from being unfaithful to her husband.

4
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:27.402
In the story the merchant's daughter hears a beautiful voice and is drawn to it like in trance and 

5
00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:31.390
goes down to meet the owner of that hypnotizing voice. 

6
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.580
She says, please take me with you I have a "stupid ugly husband".

7
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:44.780
According to Goswamy and Dllapiccola the Tutinama displays different styles suggesting 

8
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:52.250
multiple artist with different backgrounds. First, the Persian culture is depicted by the stranger 

9
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.860
playing the guitar. On the other hand, the merchant's daughter is shown in a common Indian 

10
00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.904
clothing style.  

11
00:00:59.904 --> 00:01:05.330
In that scene the stranger immediately agrees to take her with him and so they ran 

12
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.590
away into the sunset.

13
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:17.000
Being exhaust from running away, they found a quiet spot and "slept under a tree , by the side of a pond".  

14
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.150
Here, the tree displays the influence by European styles through the usage of loose brushwork.

15
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:32.610
When the merchant's daughter awoke, she noticed that her jewellery and the man were gone. 

16
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.320
She screamed after him :"Wait where are you going?"

17
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.830
Shortly she realized: God damn it, he played me!

18
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:50.610
Standing there in despair she heard something rustle.

19
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:58.190
She turned and saw a jackal with a bone in his mouth, trying to catch a fish. Unfortunately he 

20
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.690
was not successful. At the same time, he also lost his bone.

21
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:10.460
In this image we can notice a change of her dress. Her top shows clearly a change in color. 

22
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.280
This can be a symbol for a change in thought pattern.

23
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.300
The merchants daughter started laughing at the jackal for being so clumsy.

24
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.230
Catching the jackals attention, he asked her 

25
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.240
"What woman are thou, and why are thou standing here alone?"

26
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.600
The Indian culture is here shown through the jackal. 

27
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:41.010
Because the artists predominantly focused on precise illustrations of the animals in the stories.

28
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.790
The merchant's daughter told the jackal what had happened to her.

29
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.240
The jackal then advised her to go back home and to pretend she was out of her mind. 

30
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.950
This way "whoever sees you will forgive you" my dear. 

31
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:05.440
Being mortified of her actions, the woman acted according to the jackals advise

32
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.850
and went home to explain her lost jewellery.

33
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.530
Of course she authentically explained herself to her husband 

34
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.820
and to all the others who are sneaking upon them.

35
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.650
Except the women sitting beside her husband, who might actually be his mother.

36
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:33.100
But is she convincing enough? As it sure looks like all those present in the room are questioning her.

37
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:40.180
But her husband sitting in a common Mughal position, as it looks like on a 

38
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.350
bed surrounded by women, is surely convinced otherwise.

39
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:50.840
Of course, no one can argue against a mad person ;therefore, 

40
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.330
"nobody could find fault with her" and she was forgiven.
