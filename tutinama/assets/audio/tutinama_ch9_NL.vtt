00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The story of the ninth tale of the eight night, as narrated by the parrot,

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
is a tale of a shopkeeper's wife’s infidelity. The tale begins with an interaction between

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the shopkeeper’s wife and a young man who is besotted with her. The wife, infatuated

4
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
by the young man, invites him to join her later that night under the tree

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
in her court-yard. That night, the woman leaves her own bed to meet her

6
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
lover and meets him under the tree in the court-yard. After having had a

7
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
romantic encounter there, the shopkeeper’s wife and the young man fall asleep together. The specific

8
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
items that sit beneath the bed where the shop-keeper’s wife and her lover lie

9
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
in the court-yard imply much about their encounter. There are five items: a “pitcher

10
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and basin for water, a dish of breath-freshening and mildly narcotic pan leaves, along

11
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01.03.000
with bottles of perfumes” (Cleveland Art Museum 2019, web). These items, which are commonly

12
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
used during a love-affair, suggest feelings of lust and sensuality in this painting. They

13
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
allow for a better understanding of what type of relationship the two people on the

14
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
bed have. It just so happens that after a late-night business affair, the shop-keeper’s

15
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
father goes outside of the house. He finds his son’s wife sleeping with another man

16
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and decides to steal her golden anklet in order to prove her infidelity to his

17
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
son. The shop-keeper’s wife sees her father-in-law’s actions and realizes that she

18
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
has been caught being unfaithful to her husband. This is the part of the story

19
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
depicted in the first painting. The shopkeeper’s father is in the bottom left corner of

20
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
the painting walking away with his son’s wife’s golden anklet. Knowing what her father-in-law

21
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
had done, the shopkeeper’s wife concocts a plan. She tells her lover to leave and

22
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
goes to her husband where he sleeps inside. She tells her husband that she is

23
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
feeling very hot and that they should go sleep outside in the garden to cool

24
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
down, in the exact same place where she and her lover had been sleeping. In

25
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
the second painting, the shopkeeper and his wife are depicted sleeping the same bed. While

26
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
sleeping outside, his wife wakes him to tell him that she had just seen his

27
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
father steal her golden anklet. She acts very upset about what her father-in-law

28
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
did and makes the incident seem very believable. In the morning, the shopkeeper’s father approaches

29
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
his son and tells him what he had witnessed the night before. The son, angry

30
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
at his father’s accusation, told him that it was he who had been sleeping in

31
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
the court-yard with his wife. The father was very sorry, and the wife escaped

32
00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the situation punishment free because of her cunning ways. A line from the translation of

33
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
the Tutinama that corresponds perfectly to the setting of this tale is: “when the sun

34
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
was gone down, and the moon, the fixed stars, and the planets appeared.” The starry

35
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
sky depicted in the second painting is an accurate depiction of the story’s rich description

36
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
of the night.
