00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.300
The narrative context is about a story the parrot told to Khojisteh. One day, the

2
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.000
parrot was so pensive, and Khojisteh asked the parrot about why she is so pensive,

3
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and the parrot told Khojisteh a story about betrayal. There was a parrot with her

4
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.100
nestlings live together. One day, she told her nestlings that if fowlers come, the best

5
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.300
way to save their lives is to pretend they are dead, then the fowler will

6
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:52.100
throw them away from the nest. Therefore, they can avoid catching by fowlers. One day,

7
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.300
a fowler came to catch them, and young ones did what their mom said. The

8
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:05.300
fowler threw young ones as expected, and wanted to catch the parrot. Then, the parrot

9
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:13.000
told the fowler that she is a physician with perfect skills in profession, she can

10
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.200
help him to gain an amount of money for the rest of his life, and

11
00:78:21.310 --> 00:84:20.450
the fowler seemed delightful when he heard it, and took the parrot to the King

12
00:85:21.310 --> 00:91:50.450
named Roy Kamrew, who has grievous disease. When the fowler took the parrot to the

13
00:91:51.310 --> 00:99:50.450
King, the King gave the fowler ten thousand dinars for his doctor parrot. The fowler

14
00:99:51.310 --> 01:07:00.450
left. Then, the parrot started to cure the King. When the King was half cured,

15
01:07:01.310 --> 01:14:10.450
the parrot asked the King to let her out to explore a medicine to help

16
01:14:11.310 --> 01:20:30.450
the King become totally healthy. The King believed the parrot, and let the parrot out.

17
01:20:31.310 --> 01:28:20.450
However, the parrot never returned to the King. Back to the parrot and Khojisteh, the

18
01:28:21.310 --> 01:36:10.450
parrot was afraid about Khojisteh’s lover, whether or not he is like the parrot in

19
01:36:11.310 --> 01:42:30.450
the story, whether or not he is reliable. Then, Khojisteh wanted to try her lover,

20
01:42:31.310 --> 01:51:20.450
so she has gone to her gallant. As the image zoomed in, we are mainly

21
01:51:21.310 --> 01:57:30.450
focus on the fowler on the tree. The fowler postures to catch the ‘mother’ parrot.

22
01:57:31.310 --> 01:62:20.450
We can see from the posture, the degree of two feet seems like he is

23
01:62:21.310 --> 01:73:30.450
catching something. The facial expression of the fowler is the typical look in the Mughal

24
01:74:31.310 --> 01:80:20.450
paintings, as well as the degree to the sky. When the painting zoomed into the

25
01:80:21.310 --> 01:86:30.450
left side, we can see there is a fox staring at baby parrots. The fox

26
01:86:31.310 --> 01:92:20.450
is hidden from the tree in the corner of the Painting, and seems like the

27
01:92:21.310 --> 01:98:20.450
fox is waiting for a good time to catch the baby parrots. The fox is

28
01:98:21.310 --> 02:05:30.450
actually not in the story, but it appears in the image, which makes the image

29
02:05:31.310 --> 02:17:40.450
more dynamic and vivid. From the left side transfer to the right side. The background

30
02:17:41.310 --> 02:22:30.450
is a big tree and some grass on the ground, and the color is dark

31
02:22:31.310 --> 02:34:30.450
green and looks really historical and natural. Some details are really nice, like some red

32
02:34:31.310 --> 02:44:20.450
leaves, rocks, etc. That is a typical natural topic painting in that period in India.

33
02:44:21.310 --> 02:51:40.450
From the first image faded into the second image, the second image is about the

34
02:51:41.310 --> 02:59:30.450
following story. That is the scene of the fowler showing the King the parrot he

35
02:59:31.310 --> 00:00:30.450
caught is a physician with perfect skills. The background is the Palace in Mughal Period

36
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
in India, that is really typical appearance of the palaces at that time. The color

37
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
is really bright. The large use of yellow color represents the authority and power, because

38
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
yellow is a color people prefer to use on good things. As I zoomed in

39
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
the image, the main part we should focus on is the fowler and the King.

40
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
In the image, the King is looking at the parrot, and from his facial expression,

41
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
the King looks like he is satisfied with the parrot. The King’s necklace, shoes, chair,

42
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
and other his stuff all represent his authority and power. The yellow background of him

43
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
is the best representation. As I transferred the image a little bit left, three servants

44
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
are kneeling behind the fowler and caring about what happening right now. They have similar

45
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
head position and facial expression, which is the characteristics in the paintings in Mughal Period.

46
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
The servant with yellow color cloth seems like he is higher than the rest two,

47
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
also his head position is higher than the rest two.
