00:00:03.077 --> 00:00:08.871
This is one of the tales in the Tutinama. This is Tuti, the parrot who will

2
00:00:08.871 --> 00:00:13.206
be telling this story to keep his owner, Khojisteh, from sneaking off to meet

3
00:00:13.206 --> 00:00:14.345
with her lover.

4
00:00:14.345 --> 00:00:19.061
Khojisteh, before you go and *try* meeting with your lover again. Would you like

5
00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:22.500
to listen to the tale of the Four Rich Men who became poor?

6
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.603
Oh, no I shouldn’t. I best be off to my...

7
00:00:25.603 --> 00:00:32.527
Very Well. *clears throat* Once upon a time, there were four friends. The four

8
00:00:32.527 --> 00:00:37.564
men on the bottom right were very rich until they suddenly became very poor.

9
00:00:37.564 --> 00:00:42.062
They sought out the merchant for help. The merchant listened to their troubles

10
00:00:42.062 --> 00:00:46.316
and decided to help them. He handed each of the men a brown magical shell,

11
00:00:46.316 --> 00:00:50.569
instructing them to place it on their turbans. He told the men that the shells

12
00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:54.259
would lead them to their destined fortune, wherever they dropped, fortune would

13
00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:59.334
lay. The friends secured their shells to their turbans, and excitedly set off

14
00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:04.143
together to find their new fortunes. After walking for several minutes, the first

15
00:01:04.143 --> 00:01:09.170
shell fell. The first man dug and dug where the shell landed. He found a copper

16
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.467
mine. He turned to his friends and asked them to stay and share in the fortune

17
00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:17.639
they could earn from the metal. The three men refused, and continued on to

18
00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:23.677
search for their own destiny. Soon after, the second shell fell. The second man

19
00:01:23.677 --> 00:01:27.759
dug, and discovered a silver mine. He turned to his remaining two friends and

20
00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.870
asked them to stay with him. However, they refused once more.

21
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.107
The last two men with their shells continued on the journey for great fortune.

22
00:01:36.107 --> 00:01:39.479
Soon after the third shell fell, and then discovered a gold

23
00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.179
mine. The third man begged his last friend and travel-mate to stay. But he refused

24
00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:47.336
the offer again.

25
00:01:47.336 --> 00:01:52.751
The three discovered metals; copper, silver, and gold, were all used as currency

26
00:01:52.751 --> 00:01:58.058
of the Mughal era. Especially, the gold was a symbol of wealth and power, and gold

27
00:01:58.058 --> 00:02:02.922
coins were used for ceremonial purposes. Copper coins were mainly used for small

28
00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:07.787
transactions, however other materials (like sea shells and almonds) were used with

29
00:02:07.787 --> 00:02:11.313
the same functions in the outskirts of the Mughal Empire.

30
00:02:11.313 --> 00:02:16.560
The fourth man believed he would find something more precious like jewels. He

40
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.921
began to see a trend, the more they travelled the more valuable the mineral.

41
00:02:20.921 --> 00:02:28.439
Unfortunately for him… DUN DUN DUUUN… His shell led to him a mine of iron metal.

42
00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:33.261
In the Mughal Era, iron wasn’t minted and used as a Mughal currency like the first

43
00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:39.385
three metals. It was mainly used for weaponry not just in Mughal India but in

44
00:02:39.385 --> 00:02:45.656
Europe as well. Gun production began much later in Babur’s reign in the 15th century.

45
00:02:45.656 --> 00:02:51.655
You can see on his painted face, the crease of the eyebrows possibly showing angst

46
00:02:51.655 --> 00:02:57.092
and the frown of the lips. Iron was worth a lot less than the copper, silver, and

47
00:02:57.092 --> 00:02:59.367
gold metals in that time period.

48
00:02:59.367 --> 00:03:03.840
In his despair, he decided to go back to his friend’s in hopes that their offer

49
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.579
was still open. But after searching for a long time, they were nowhere to be

50
00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:13.990
found. Failing to find them, he reluctantly tried to go back to his own mine.

51
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.125
However, that too has disappeared.

52
00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:22.389
The fourth man abandoned his friends in search for his great fortune. Realizing

53
00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:26.604
that he missed the opportunities because of his greed, he was left with nothing.

54
00:03:26.604 --> 00:03:27.825
The End.

55
00:03:27.825 --> 00:03:35.214
*clapping* That was a great story, Tuti. But now I have to meet my lover later

56
00:03:35.214 --> 00:03:36.629
tonight now that it's sunrise.
