00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.351
The tales of the Tutinama begin with our main character, Khojisteh. Khojisteh is married and madly in love with her husband, Miemun

2
00:00:10.351 --> 00:00:18.184
One day Miemun went out into the town and purchased a talking parrot. Since Miemun loves Khojisteh so much

3
00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:23.029
he decided to purchase another bird called Sharuk who would accompany the parrot.

4
00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:29.702
One day Miemun decides to go on a journey for a while, he gets on a ship with other men and away he goes.

5
00:00:29.702 --> 00:00:36.575
While Miemun is away Khojisteh finds herself gazing out her window one evening when a handsome prince spots her

6
00:00:36.575 --> 00:00:45.077
Ever since Miemun left she has been sad and lonely. The prince fancies her in return and decides to ask her to accompany him

7
00:00:45.077 --> 00:00:53.431
that evening. At first, Khojisteh did not agree with the proposal, however, as the day reveals

8
00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:56.125
and night casts a veil over her actions, she would wait upon the prince after midnight.

9
00:00:56.125 --> 00:01:05.486
Here we can see Khojisteh awaiting her prince. This portion of the image is especially important because it brings the fairytale principle to the story.

10
00:01:05.486 --> 00:01:12.987
As Khojisteh awaits her prince from her tower we can compare it to a princess awaiting her prince we come and rescue her.

11
00:01:12.987 --> 00:01:21.934
As Khojisteh was thinking of her prince she decided that she would go meet him. That evening she got herself all dressed up and went to speak the Sharuk.

12
00:01:21.934 --> 00:01:27.842
Sharuk told her that she must not commit this action because it would be disgraceful.

13
00:01:27.842 --> 00:01:35.280
The Sharuk made Khojisteh so angry that she seized the bird by both legs and threw her against the ground, killing the bird.

14
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.038
The colour red is most useful in this image because it shows the harsh reality of death in this picture.

15
00:01:40.038 --> 00:01:47.330
The colour red is usually represented with the aspect of death which is why it was used to well in this picture

16
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.435
Now that the Sharuk is dead she decides to speak with the parrot.

17
00:01:51.435 --> 00:02:00.631
The parrot was terrified of Khujasta so rather than telling her what he really thought he decided to tell her the story of a merchant named Farukh Beg

18
00:02:00.631 --> 00:02:08.897
Farukh Beg was a merchant who had a parrot in whom he trusted with all of his goods. Farukh Beg decided to go on a journey

19
00:02:08.897 --> 00:02:14.749
and shortly after his departure his wife met a young Mughul. Every evening following

20
00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:19.486
the wife invited the young Mughul into their home where they slept in the same bed until morning

21
00:02:19.486 --> 00:02:28.048
The parrot saw everything that had happened. When Farukh returned from his trip and found out about his wife and the young Mughul he was angry.

22
00:02:28.048 --> 00:02:35.617
The wife thought that it was the parrot who had told Farukh what had happened and so that evening at midnight she went to the parrot and

23
00:02:35.617 --> 00:02:43.627
plucked away all his feathers and threw the parrot outside. The woman told herself that the parrot was dead, although he was not.

24
00:02:43.627 --> 00:02:49.237
He had learned to survive on the streets and lived in the burying ground. When Farukh had found out

25
00:02:49.237 --> 00:02:52.322
what had happened to his parrot he throws his wife out of the house.

26
00:02:52.322 --> 00:03:01.154
The wife headed to the burying ground where the parrot then told her that he would reunite her with Farukh if she did what he said

27
00:03:01.154 --> 00:03:08.249
She agreed and the parrot told her that in order to be reunited with her husband she must shave her head and remain 40 days without food

28
00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:13.481
and at that time the parrot would pardon her of her sins and reunite the two lovers.

29
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:20.001
In this image, we can see the woman clearly in the burying ground with the other birds which can show how

30
00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:24.391
unimportant she has become to Farukh Beg who is sitting above on his pedestal.

31
00:03:24.391 --> 00:03:35.464
After the wife had completed the parrots' tasks the parrot said to her “I am the purchased parrot of your lord, and thou art my lady...

32
00:03:35.464 --> 00:03:45.726
I will reunite you and your husband. Be assured of my fidelity, and that I am not a back-biter, and that I should have told our faults to your husband;

33
00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:49.202
but, on the contrary, I have preserved my allegiance”.

34
00:03:49.202 --> 00:03:54.975
The parrot goes off to tell her husband that he can return to her and he does.

35
00:03:54.975 --> 00:04:00.293
The husband went to get his wife back and from that time they lived together in perfect harmony.

36
00:04:00.293 --> 00:04:08.951
The parrot told the story then continued by saying she may arise quickly and find the prince because he would keep her secret.

37
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:17.660
However, it was now dawn and so instead Khojisteh decided to go to bed instead, and postpone her departure.
