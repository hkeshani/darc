00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:05.944
After the sun had sunk into the west, and the moon appeared in the east,

2
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.167
a woman named Khojsteh, wants to leave her home and cheat on her husband, with

3
00:00:12.174 --> 00:00:17.461
the guy she loves. However, her talking parrot ends up stopping her with a story.

4
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.432
Just like many other Persian, Indian, and Egyptian tales, a parrot is often the narrator.

5
00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:30.562
 The parrot’s story is about a monarch who had two sons. Whose Father had just

6
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.949
passed away, and the oldest son would become King, his first order was to have

7
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.243
his younger brother killed. Resulting in the younger prince fleeing the kingdom.

8
00:00:41.267 --> 00:00:45.423
The young prince one day came across a pond, where he gazed at a snake

9
00:00:45.453 --> 00:00:50.717
with a frog in its mouth. The prince called out to the snake, giving the

10
00:00:50.756 --> 00:00:56.847
 frog a chance to escape the snake’s grip. The prince felt ashamed that he had

11
00:00:56.864 --> 00:01:01.677
taken the food away from the snake, so he gave the snake a piece of

12
00:01:01.692 --> 00:01:07.064
his own flesh. The snake slithered back to his wife, who said that the piece

13
00:01:07.089 --> 00:01:13.101
of flesh was savory and told her husband that he must show his gratitude. Therefore,

14
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:19.138
 the snake turned into his human form, Khaliss, and told the Prince he will

15
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.247
enter into his service. The frog who was saved by the Prince, also felt he

16
00:01:24.273 --> 00:01:28.953
had a debt to pay to the Prince, so he turned into his human form

17
00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:34.990
named Mukhless, and sought to serve the Prince. The three of them from there travelled

18
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.820
into a city, to find a king. Once they came across a King, the Prince

19
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:46.434
told his highness, that he was capable of killing one hundred men. He requested that

20
00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:51.636
 the King pay him one thousand rupees daily for his services, and he would be

21
00:01:51.676 --> 00:01:57.116
willing to do any task or business, the King wished. One day the King was

22
00:01:57.167 --> 00:02:02.317
fishing at a river, and his ring fell off into the water. The King asked

23
00:02:02.378 --> 00:02:06.682
the Prince if he could fetch the ring. So, the Prince asked Mukhless, if he

24
00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:12.348
could turn back into his frog and find the ring. Mukhless jumped into the water,

25
00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:18.106
making wave ripples like a big rock dropping into the water across the whole pond

26
00:02:18.156 --> 00:02:24.794
and started to search. Mukhless had no problem and instantly recovered the ring. The King

27
00:02:24.832 --> 00:02:29.716
was very impressed and started to be very kind to the prince for returning his

28
00:02:29.767 --> 00:02:34.732
ring. Sometime after that, the King’s daughter was bit by a snake and fell ill,

29
00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:39.654
but sadly the physicians’ remedies had no effect. So, the King asked the Prince for

30
00:02:39.688 --> 00:02:45.599
help, however the Prince was feeling distant, and didn’t want to get involved. So Khaliss

31
00:02:45.656 --> 00:02:50.057
took it upon himself to turn back into a snake and suck the poison out

32
00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.258
of the princess. Shown in this picture, Khaliss cures the princess like he is giving

33
00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.946
the princess a kiss with plenty of tongue. This cured the princess instantly. The King

34
00:03:01.982 --> 00:03:07.054
was so delighted, and ordered that his daughter marry the Prince, who was now the King’s

35
00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:12.813
lieutenant. Both Khaliss and Mukhless decided that it was a good time to leave, now

36
00:03:12.878 --> 00:03:17.085
that they had both served the Prince well; they too wanted to return to their

37
00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:22.751
own habitations. so they left the Prince with his new kingdom and family.
