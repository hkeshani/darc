00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.950
The tale begins with Khojisteh going to talk to the parrot in the night when the moon had risen.

2
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:15.400
Khojisteh all covered in gold and jewels wanted to go see a secret admirer since her husband was away (OOHHH..).


3
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.420
However, the parrot strongly advised her not to go since he said the secret admirer

4
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.500
would quit his affection for her with all the jewels she was wearing, similar to

5
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.770
the way the carpenter and goldsmith’s friendship broke (uh oh).


6
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.120
Since the parrot had said that, Khojisteh wanted to know more about the carpenter and

7
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.120
goldsmith’s story. So, the parrot began to tell the story. and here it goes ...


8
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.150
Both the goldsmith and carpenter took on a journey together and were struggling to pay for the expenses in the city.


9
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.820
Due to this stressful situation, they came up with a plan to pretend to be Brahmin;


10
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.290
and go to the temple where there were golden images for them to steal (GASP)!


11
00:00:61.000 --> 00:00:66.960
According to the goldsmith and carpenter this was way to become RICHHH (crazy eh, Khojisteh).


12
00:00:66.960 --> 00:00:73.990
Moving forward, they both went to the temple and began to worship. However, the


13
00:00:73.990 --> 00:00:78.000
way they worshipped was quite shaming for the other Brahmins to see and they


14
00:00:78.000 --> 00:00:84.630
started to leave one by one (I mean why wouldn’t they). Soon after some days,


15
00:00:84.630 --> 00:00:90.340
the temple was entirely empty; only the goldsmith and carpenter were left.


16
00:00:91.000 --> 00:00:98.140
Once the damage was done, they both went back to their homes, but there was an issue!


17
00:00:99.000 --> 00:01:04.500
Sometime after, the goldsmith heard about the issue, and went to the carpenter’s place.

18
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.490
“Thou has forgotten our long friendship” said the goldsmith. However, the carpenter played the same



19
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.950
 game the goldsmith played initially and made it seem as though he did nothing. But


20
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.520
the goldsmith knew something was up since he saw two bear cubs and not his kids.


21
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.300
The carpenter said, once the cubs are let loose and if they can recognize


22
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.320
you amongst all the people, I guess they are your children and, of course the


23
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.890
bear cubs recognized their father (I mean how could they not, with that stylish turban).


24
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.400
The symbolic meaning of a turban is faith and royalty. Within history, many Mughals wore


25
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.730
turbans to show prestige, power, and superiority.


26
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:53.280
Finally after, the goldsmith asked the carpenter for forgiveness of his deeds and said he


27
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.790
would return his share of gold if he gives him his children back.


28
00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:62.900
The carpenter was quite upset with the goldsmith for his actions since he was unfair and dishonest.


29
00:01:64.430 --> 00:01:67.620
The goldsmith brought his share of gold to the carpenter, and the carpenter


30
00:01:67.630 --> 00:01:73.670
brought the children back to their original selves.At the end of the story, the parrot once again told


31
00:01:73.670 --> 00:01:82.500
Khojisteh to not carry the jewels with her. After, Khojisteh wanted to take off her jewelry and go her sweet-heart.
