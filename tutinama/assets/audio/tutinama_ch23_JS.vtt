00:00:03.882 --> 00:00:07.580
One evening, Kojisteh consults with the parrot once again that she is about to leave to go

2
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.970
see her lover and the parrot tells her a story to give her advice on how she can be

3
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:18.825
successful. He tells her to act wisely so that she can avoid any possible misfortune and be

4
00:00:18.825 --> 00:00:23.559
able to gain everything she desires. The parrot illustrates his advice with a story about a

5
00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:29.673
Brahmin. Brahmins represent the top of the social and economic hierarchy in Vedic Hinduism

6
00:00:29.673 --> 00:00:34.491
and are characterized as very intelligent. They are part of the Varna from which Hindu

7
00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:39.120
priests are drawn, and they are responsible for teaching and maintaining sacred knowledge.

8
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.719
The Brahmin falls in love with the princess of Babylon who is part of the Kshatriya caste,

9
00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.636
which is a doomed romance because marriages tend to be arranged by parents and it is frowned

10
00:00:48.636 --> 00:00:53.926
upon to marry someone of a different caste. However, using his wit, the Brahmin ultimately

11
00:00:53.926 --> 00:00:59.629
“[gets] possession not only of his beloved, but also of money and property, without suffering

12
00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.168
any misfortune” (118). The parrot continues the story about how the Brahmin and the princess

13
00:01:05.168 --> 00:01:10.375
fall in love at first sight when they meet in a garden one day. After parting ways, the

14
00:01:10.375 --> 00:01:15.787
Brahmin decides he must find a way to reunite with the princess once again. The Brahmin seeks

15
00:01:15.787 --> 00:01:20.181
help from a magician wearing an orange robe, who offers the Brahmin a solution to help him

16
00:01:20.181 --> 00:01:26.759
find his lover. The magician gives the Brahmin a magic ball. He explains that if he puts the

17
00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.793
ball in his mouth, everyone who encounters him will actually see him as a woman. The Brahmin

18
00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:37.846
and the magician form a plan to approach the King of Babylon undercover in hopes of reuniting

19
00:01:37.846 --> 00:01:43.301
the Brahmin and the princess. The Brahmin does as the magician says, and transforms himself

20
00:01:43.301 --> 00:01:47.929
into a woman with long, dark hair and wearing a blue skirt, and they venture off to the

21
00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:54.211
palace. The Brahmin, as a woman, and the magician arrive at the palace to meet with the King

22
00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:59.997
of Babylon. While the Brahmin has been transformed into a woman, the magician has also

23
00:01:59.997 --> 00:02:04.781
transformed himself into a Brahmin wearing red pants, so he is more respected by the King

24
00:02:04.781 --> 00:02:10.005
than if he were just a magician. The magician (disguised as a Brahmin) introduces the woman

25
00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:16.487
to the King as being his son’s wife. The magician (disguised as a Brahmin) explains to the

26
00:02:16.487 --> 00:02:21.185
King wearing an orange robe, seated on his throne, that his son has left and he needs to go

27
00:02:21.185 --> 00:02:26.250
search for him. He asks that the King allow his son’s wife to stay at the palace while he

28
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.591
searches for his son. The King graciously agrees as a favour to the magician and sends the

29
00:02:32.591 --> 00:02:37.055
Brahmin (who is disguised as a woman) to stay with the princess and they become very close

30
00:02:37.055 --> 00:02:42.179
friends. Eventually, the Brahmin probes the princess to learn about her secrets and the

31
00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:46.642
princess reveals that she is in love with the Brahmin and explains her situation and longing

32
00:02:46.642 --> 00:02:52.015
to be with him again. The Brahmin immediately takes the magic ball out of his mouth,

33
00:02:52.015 --> 00:02:57.430
revealing his true identity to the princess. They are overjoyed and rekindle their love, but

34
00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.338
they still must keep their love a secret. Still disguised as a woman, the Brahmin and the

35
00:03:03.338 --> 00:03:08.736
princess continue to be best friends rather than lovers, and only they know the real truth.

36
00:03:08.736 --> 00:03:13.778
One day, the Brahmin woman was bathing, and the King of Babylon’s son, who wears

37
00:03:13.778 --> 00:03:19.646
an orange robe like his father’s but a different crown, was admiring her from the rooftop. He

38
00:03:19.646 --> 00:03:25.514
becomes smitten with her and he falls in love at first sight. The princess discovers this and

39
00:03:25.514 --> 00:03:30.721
is completely distraught that her brother has fallen in love with her lover. The Brahmin and

40
00:03:30.721 --> 00:03:35.019
the princess decide it is best for them to escape and leave the palace so they can be

41
00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:41.450
together without restraints. In a ploy to enable the couple to escape together, the magician

42
00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.905
helps once again. He transforms both the Brahmin and the princess into men so they can leave

43
00:03:46.905 --> 00:03:54.000
the palace unnoticed. In order to live happily ever after, they come up with another plan.

44
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.943
The magician, still disguised as a Brahmin, once again approaches the King of Babylon to

45
00:03:58.943 --> 00:04:03.820
retrieve his son’s wife whom he had left with the King earlier in the story. However, since

46
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.366
the Brahmin and the princess had successfully escaped, the King explains that she has

47
00:04:08.366 --> 00:04:14.232
disappeared. Upon hearing this, the magician falls to his knees while holding a gold knife

48
00:04:14.232 --> 00:04:20.295
and he threatens to stab himself to death. In response, the King offers compensation by

49
00:04:20.295 --> 00:04:25.667
giving the magician a huge fortune. One of the King’s servants brings the magician a huge

50
00:04:25.667 --> 00:04:30.461
bowl full of gold, and the magician gives the Brahmin and the princess the gold. With their

51
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:35.089
new-found fortune, they live happily ever after in freedom without any restraints on their

52
00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:40.426
love. By the end of the story, the sun began to rise and Kojisteh deferred

53
00:04:40.426 --> 00:04:42.988
her visit to her lover once again.
