00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.100
This is the story of Khojisteh wanting to go visit her lover, but the Parrot

2
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.150
tries to encourage her not to do so, by telling her a story about the the Soldier’s wife.

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.000
Khojisteh: Ugh, I really miss my bae and want to go and visit him so bad.

4
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.000
Parrot: Hunny, your husband is away working hard and you must show him some respect…

5
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.000
Let me tell you the story of the “soldiers wife put to confusion of the nobleman”

6
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.600
The Parrot begins telling the story by the introduction of the Soldier.

7
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.000
Soldier: My wife is the most beautiful woman on this planet, and I am certain that

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
she is cheating on me, because like who wouldn’t want a piece of that?

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So, the soldier goes home to see his wife to make sure she wasn’t cheating on him.

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Wife: Umm hello? Why are you back… You’re supposed to be at work.

11
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Soldier: Babe, I’m worried that you’re cheating on me… You’re just so wonderful and perfect,

12
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and I feel like the luckiest man in the world, but I am always under apprehension because of those things.

13
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.900
Wife: You’ve got to be kidding me. “no one can seduce a virtuous woman; and if a women

14
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.000
is vicious, no husband is able to guard her”...

15
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Let me tell you the story of the Jowgee.

16
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
There was once a Jowgee who kept his wife on his back as he wandered the desert.

17
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
This women, who was at least a ten crazy, was guilty of infidelity with one hundred men.

18
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It must be noted that throughout the Mughal empire, elephants were a symbol of

19
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
good luck, which explains the woman’s luck one hundred times.

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
There was a man who was wandering the desert and spotted an elephant with a litter on its back.

21
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This man ran to the nearest tree and climbed up it and spied on this elephant. The elephant

22
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
approached his tree and left his litter near the tree, while he went to go have a bite to eat.

23
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
A beautiful woman appeared out of the litter, and the man was starstruck. The man descended from the

24
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
tree and introduced himself to the beautiful woman. She introduced herself in a seductive way to the man.

25
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
This beautiful, crazy, seductive woman kept a string full of knots, and every time she shacked a

26
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
different guy, she added a new knot. So moral of the story, her husband was worried about her chastity,

27
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
so he kept her with him at all times, which made her fall out of love with him, and cheat on him.

28
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Soldier: Okay I get it, I’m low key being paranoid. I guess I’ll go back to work, unless you want me to stay?

29
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Wife: Of course I want you to stay, but I think it’s best that you go back to work

30
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and serve our country, so you can someday be with me forever.

31
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Here, take this nosegay with you. It’s a flower bouquet, and symbol of my chastity towards you.

32
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
It’ll be in bloom if I am being virtuous. But, if it dies, then you know that I have

33
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
cheated with another. This will hopefully keep your mind at ease.

34
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So, the Soldier took the flower his wife gave him and rode to the city where he was stationed.

35
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
His mind was now at ease, because his wife had given him a symbol of

36
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
her chastity that would be alive for as long as her chastity remained virtuous.
