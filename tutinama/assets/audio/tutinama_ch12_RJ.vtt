00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.350
The Tutinama tales are Persian series of 52 stories which is narrated by the parrot,

2
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.250
as he tries to distract his mistress from committing an illicit affair, while her husband

3
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.00
is on business trip. Each night the parrot narrates a new story to distract the mistress.

4
00:00:19.00 --> 00:00:24.10
The one that I will be narrating is the Tale of the 15th night: The Lion Disturbed

5
00:00:24.10 --> 00:00:31.00
by mice who eat the food trapped in his aging teeth. The 15th tale begins with an old Lion

6
00:00:31.00 --> 00:00:36.40
 with decaying tooth resting on the ground. The surrounding setting of the picture radiates

7
00:00:36.40 --> 00:00:40.00
a sense of gloomy environment. The flowers painted on the rocks are not blossoming and seem

8
00:00:40.00 --> 00:00:47.00
dead or even nonexistent. The roses in front of the lion are dipping downwards.

9
00:00:47.00 --> 00:00:52.450
Whenever the lion ate food it will get stuck in his decaying tooth and once he

10
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.00
falls asleep, the mice will try to eat the food that was stuck in his decaying tooth.

11
00:00:57.00 --> 00:00:63.00
The lion is tired and decides to take some rest. He falls asleep worried about the annoying mice

12
00:00:63.00 --> 00:00:69.00
that disturb his sleep every day. Yet once again, the situation repeats itself. As soon as the

13
00:00:69.00 --> 00:00:75:00
lion is asleep the mice would start eating the food on his tooth. Lion would wake up as the

14
00:00:75.00 --> 00:00:81.450
 mice disturb him in the middle of his sleep. The lion decided to consult with the fox to find

15
00:00:81.450 --> 00:00:88.450
an effective solution to fix his disturbance and allow him to rest peacefully. The fox came up

16
00:00:088.450 --> 00:00:96.450
with an effective plan. Fox suggested that he should appoint the cat as his guard to stop the

17
00:00:96.450 --> 00:00:103
disturbances he has been suffering with. Lion agrees with the Fox’s advice and decides to

18
00:00:103 --> 00:00:110
appoint cat. The cat’s duty is to guard the Lion as he sleeps and fight off the mice that are

19
00:00:110 --> 00:00:116
causing him disturbance. In this scene, the landscape seems pleasant like spring. The flowers

20
00:00:116 --> 00:00:121
are blossoming on the stone paintings and trees are bearing fruits. The environment is

21
00:00:121 --> 00:00:128
positive and lively. However, the next scene is very gruesome. As the cat is scaring the mice

22
00:00:128 --> 00:00:135
away one by one, so that they don’t disturb the Lion. , However, the cat would only scare

23
00:00:135 --> 00:00:141
of the mice and not kill them, as the cat thought that if there were no mice then lion will

24
00:00:141 --> 00:00:146
have no reason to reward and praise the cat. The mice are scattering everywhere in chaos,

25
00:00:146 --> 00:00:150
scared of the cat eating them. But the Lion sleeps peacefully. Lion is happy to finally have

26
00:00:150 --> 00:00:158
peaceful sleep, he decides to reward the cat with a promotion. One day, the cat decides to

27
00:00:158 --> 00:00:164
take a day off for business purpose and sends her kitten as her replacement. The kitten while

28
00:00:164 --> 00:00:169
on the duty kills all the mice. When the cat returns she is furious that kitten killed all

29
00:00:169 --> 00:00:175
mice. Soon the lion cut ties with the cat and eradicates the honour he had once given to

30
00:00:175 --> 00:00:181
the cat, for not doing the job faithfully in the first place.
