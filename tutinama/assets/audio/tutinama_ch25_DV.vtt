00:00:04.573 --> 00:00:09.605
The Tuti-nama is a compiled series of stories that is told to a woman by a

2
00:00:09.606 --> 00:00:14.209
parrot to keep her company  to avoid her leaving the house to have an affair

3
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.073
with someone for her husband has left her alone whilst he is on a business trip.

4
00:00:20.406 --> 00:00:25.121
For 52 nights the parrot entertains her with fables so that she does not tire of

5
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.469
sitting at home alone.

6
00:00:28.635 --> 00:00:34.948
Chapter 25 “Of a Woman, who, having gone to buy Sugar had an Amour with a

7
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.439
Grocer” is told on the eighth night.

8
00:00:41.856 --> 00:00:47.231
The story follows a woman who was told to go and buy some sugar at the market

9
00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:52.344
by her husband. The wife agrees, takes the money, and goes and purchases a

10
00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:58.031
“seer” (p 127) which is approximately 2 pounds worth of sugar. Notice the detail

11
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.788
to her clothing. Her veil is see through, large portions of her body are on

12
00:01:02.886 --> 00:01:06.898
display and her jewelry is excessive and eye catching.

13
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.990
As she was buying the sugar the “grocer plied her with pleasant discourse”

14
00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:18.454
and she fell victim to his charms. She left the sugar bag outside whilst she was

15
00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.294
partaking in the adulterous activity with the grocer in his house. As you can

16
00:01:23.487 --> 00:01:28.261
see in the image they are situated at the bottom of the house not in the domed

17
00:01:28.294 --> 00:01:33.987
area of the house - which can be seen as a holy place such as in temples. This

18
00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.960
gives the reader a visual representation of how the artwork conveys the message

19
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.475
that this act of love making is not part of the holy covenant of marriage.

20
00:01:45.446 --> 00:01:50.147
Whilst the grocer and the wife were in the house the shopman exchanged the sugar

21
00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.258
for sand in hopes of exposing the wife to her husband.

22
00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.898
After some time the wife went back home with her two pound bag. You can see just

23
00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:05.862
how much time has passed because of the colouring of the sky in the paintings.

24
00:02:06.344 --> 00:02:11.648
Notice the mountains are now purple rather than the sandy brown as well as the

25
00:02:11.718 --> 00:02:16.621
sky having some more details resulting in a beautiful sunset concept.

26
00:02:17.196 --> 00:02:22.531
The husband meets his wife and looks into the bag to find sand instead of the

27
00:02:22.633 --> 00:02:27.517
sugar he was expecting. Immediately he questioned her.

28
00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:33.528
Being the cunning woman she is, she came up with an elaborate story to

29
00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:39.502
account for the sand instead of sugar, the lost money, and the amount of time

30
00:02:39.808 --> 00:02:45.918
that had passed. The wife without hesitation started “As soon as I got out of

31
00:02:45.996 --> 00:02:50.969
the house an ox ran at me, upon which I took to flight, and tumbled on the

32
00:02:51.183 --> 00:02:56.120
ground; the money fell out of my hand, and as I was ashamed to look for it

33
00:02:56.237 --> 00:03:00.606
before the men who were present, I took up the sand from the spot, and have

34
00:03:00.683 --> 00:03:01.737
brought it here”.

35
00:03:02.308 --> 00:03:07.461
Her husband adorns her with kisses as he forgives her and feels sorry for her.

36
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.454
However, notice how again they are not in the dome, the holy place of the house.

37
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:20.079
Again her sin does not allow her to be in that holy place as expressed in the artwork.

38
00:03:20.204 --> 00:03:25.211
In the dome structure we can see some of the architecture using the arches both

39
00:03:25.362 --> 00:03:30.153
inwardly in the window and outwardly on the surrounding ledge.

40
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.308
At the end of the day, the parrot is calming the woman with a story that she

41
00:03:35.808 --> 00:03:41.017
could use to trick her own husband but alas, by the time she made up her mind to

42
00:03:41.335 --> 00:03:47.000
go find her lover the sun rose and “her departure was deferred”.
