<v Shanelle Connell>In the fifteenth tale of the Tutinama (Tales of a Parrot), our scene starts with

00:05.210 --> 00:12.120
<v Shanelle Connell>our narrator – a very cheeky talking parrot. In our overarching narrative, he tells our primary

00:12.120 --> 00:18.220
<v Shanelle Connell>female character, Khhojasta, a story. It is his tactic to keep her from having an

00:18.220 --> 00:25.070
<v Shanelle Connell>illicit affair on her husband while he’s slaving away at work. The story? 

00:25.070 --> 00:32.150
<v Shanelle Connell>A lesson about four rich men who became poor. These four men approach a wise philosopher

00:32.150 --> 00:38.000
<v Shanelle Connell>on their conquest for riches. He advises them that if they are to find

00:38.000 --> 00:42.200
<v Shanelle Connell>their fortunes, they must place a ball upon their heads and watch for where

00:42.200 --> 00:47.000
<v Shanelle Connell>it falls off – as that is where they will need to dig for their prize.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.070
<v Shanelle Connell>These four friends set on their adventure, beginning to hunt and dig.

00:53.070 --> 00:58.190
<v Shanelle Connell>The first man finds copper. The second? A mine of silver.

00:58.190 --> 01:05.000
<v Shanelle Connell>And the third discovers a mine of gold.  It is along their journey to wealth

01:05.000 --> 01:09.170
<v Shanelle Connell>that the first two men asked their remaining friends to share their finding, but they

01:09.170 --> 01:13.000
<v Shanelle Connell>are denied, as the last two men wanted to pursue more riches.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.220
<v Shanelle Connell>However, the third man asks the fourth man if he'd like to enjoy the gold

01:18.220 --> 01:24.100
<v Shanelle Connell>he’d found with him. To his dismay, the fourth man declines in pursuit of a

01:24.100 --> 01:32.000
<v Shanelle Connell>mine of jewels. An act of greed at it’s finest! Thus, the fourth man set

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
<v Shanelle Connell>out on his own mission to achieve ultimate wealth and fortune. Searching and searching, the

01:38.000 --> 01:43.170
<v Shanelle Connell>ball falls off the fourth man’s head, marking the spot of his hopeful fortune.

01:43.170 --> 01:49:000
<v Shanelle Connell>He digs and digs, becoming more excited with each time the shovel hits the ground.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.100
<v Shanelle Connell>Surely he was going to find a mine full of rubies, diamonds, and stunning jewels.

01:55.100 --> 02:00.150
<v Shanelle Connell>As he reaches the bottom, to his dismay, the fourth man only finds a mine

02:00.150 --> 02:05.150
<v Shanelle Connell>of iron. Disappointed in his lack of wealth, he returns to the spot where his

02:05.150 --> 02:10.200
<v Shanelle Connell>friend found his gold mine. Only to be utterly shocked! Both his friend and the

02:10.200 --> 02:16.180
<v Shanelle Connell>gold mine were gone! Feeling disheveled, he returns to his iron mine with regret and

02:16.180 --> 02:22.060
<v Shanelle Connell>sourness in his heart… Yet, as he returns he discovers that his iron mine has

02:22.060 --> 02:28.170
<v Shanelle Connell>disappeared too! Sulking and sad, he goes to return to find the philosopher… His journey

02:28.170 --> 02:33.150
<v Shanelle Connell>back was ridden with guilt, as he lost his friends to the monster of pride

02:33.150 --> 02:42.050
<v Shanelle Connell>and greed. Each step closer to the philosopher, he felt more hopeless. Unfortunately… his unlucky

02:42.050 --> 02:48.200
<v Shanelle Connell>streak persists as he finds the philosopher vanished as well! When the fourth man had

02:48.200 --> 02:57.000
<v Shanelle Connell>realized his utter fate, he lamented his choices – learning the lesson that nothing good comes from greed.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
<v Shanelle Connell>Alas, we return to the parrot as our story closes… Only to find that he

03:03.000 --> 03:11.060
<v Shanelle Connell>succeeds in keeping Khojasta entertained long enough that she misses her meeting with her lover.
