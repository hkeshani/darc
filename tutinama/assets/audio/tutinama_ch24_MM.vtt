00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880
The Tuti-nama was one of the first manuscripts commissioned by the Mughal Indian Emperor
 Akbar in 1560,

2
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.250
it’s artistic style fused together both Persian and Indian influences.

3
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.000
This was mirroring Akbar’s social and political desire to blend Muslim and Hindu cultures.

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Within his kingship, Akbar aspired to use these manuscripts as a mode of expressing a

5
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.750
larger concept of nation and knowledge, he said manuscripts were

6
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.070
“ a source of wisdom and an antidote against the poison of ignorance.”

7
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:43.260
These manuscript images are depicting the 34th night of Tuti-nama, beginning with the

8
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.670
main character Khojisteh speaking with her beloved parrot about committing adultery

9
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.340
while her merchant husband’s away on a business trip. Khojisteh is asking the parrot

10
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.060
how she can test his understanding and wisdom. If he is wise, Khojisteh will

11
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:04.040
strengthen her friendship with him, if not, she will test her patience with him.

12
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:14.360
The parrot advises her to tell him the story of “How the son of the King of Babylon fall in Love with a Girl”,

13
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.000
and ask him for an answer to the story.

14
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.930
This story begins with the son of the Babylonian King entering a temple.

15
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:31.320
Once in the temple, the prince observes a beautiful girl and quickly becomes infatuated with her.

16
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:40.230
He says, “The brightness of whose countenance resembled the moon, as did her jetty locks the darkest night,

17
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:46.590
; her stature was as erect as the cypress, and her walk graceful as the pheasant.”

18
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:55.850
He was smitten by her charm.He lays down his head to the feet of the idol,

19
00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.260
praying that if the young woman should marry him, he shall sever his head as a sacrifice.

20
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:09.670
Later that evening, he sends a letter to the beautiful girl’s father asking for her hand in marriage.

21
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.890
Her father consents and the two are united.

22
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.720
The idol the prince prays to is a faceless figure dressed in traditional Hindu clothing.

23
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:29.060
This gives the effect of an unknown or unspecified power, furthermore, that this spiritual being is not

24
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:36.050
bound to one single representation. Giving the audience power to interpret the divine Hindu figure as they

25
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.000
wish. It also could have been rubbed faceless later in time

26
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.710
to align with the Muslim tradition to prohibit depiction of the divine.

27
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:53.230
Days later the newlyweds are invited to the girl’s father’s house with the prince’s companion a Brahmin.

28
00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:04.630
The prince sees the temple and remembers his sacrificial vow to the idol.The prince enters the temple alone,

29
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:11.190
kneeling before the idol he serves his own head.The Brahmin enters the temple looking for the prince and

30
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:22.350
finds him decapitated. The Brahmin is terrified at this horrific sight, and he believes people will deem

31
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:31.920
him the murderer because he has no alibi.He believes the only way to be considered innocent in the

32
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.620
beheading of the prince is to kill himself by cutting off his own head.

33
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:47.950
The wife of the prince walks into the temple minutes later, and is shocked to find her husband and the

34
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.040
Brahmin beheaded at the feet of the idol. In hysteria, she thinks about severing her own head to be

35
00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:02.920
cremated with her new husband. When all of a sudden, she hears a mysterious voice talking to her from the statue,

36
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:15.440
that is now female. The voice tells her if she places her husband’s head on the Brahmins body,

37
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:25.860
and the Brahmin’s head on her husband’s body that they will be suddenly be brought back to life.

38
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.480
The beautiful wife does this, in a suspenseful moment like out of a horror movie,

39
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.870
both men are instantly brought back to life with their heads on each others bodies!

40
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:43.860
Immediately, a dispute between the husband’s head and the Brahmin’s head ensue,

41
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:52.480
both claiming the wife as their own. This story within a story ends here.

42
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.980
The parrot tells Khojisteh if she wants to test her lovers understanding and wisdom,

43
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.780
that she must ask which man in the story has the right to the wife.

44
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:11.190
Is it the husband’s head on the Brahmin’s body or the Brahmin’s head on the husband’s body?

45
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.560
The parrot states,

46
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:21.860
“the owner of the women is the head because the head is the seat of wisdom and presides over the body.”
