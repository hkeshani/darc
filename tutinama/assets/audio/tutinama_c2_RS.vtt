00:00:06.672 --> 00:00:12.903
This is a story of the King of Teberistan and his undoubtedly loyal servant.

2
00:00:12.903 --> 00:00:20.931
The story is told by a parrot to the wife of his owner. The wife’s name is

3
00:00:20.931 --> 00:00:24.422
Kojisteh. The parrot attempts to prevent the wife to meet her secret lover

4
00:00:24.422 --> 00:00:29.572
while her husband is away on a long journey. It is a peculiar story, one of

5
00:00:29.572 --> 00:00:35.780
extreme devotion, sacrifice, loyalty, and love. The parrot’s story begins with

6
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.482
this guy here in the blue robes on the right. This smug character is the King

7
00:00:42.482 --> 00:00:48.845
of Teberistan. He hosted a feast for his highest members in his government.

8
00:00:48.845 --> 00:00:55.436
It is a banquet serving a variety of alcohols and delicious foods. Then, all of a sudden...

9
00:00:55.436 --> 00:00:58.261
This mysterious character shows up!


10
00:00:58.261 --> 00:01:04.617
This man is the one and only sentinel. Shortly after he appears, the king’s


11
00:01:04.617 --> 00:01:12.502
court asks who he is. He proclaims “I am a gladiator, and a lion catcher. I


12
00:01:12.502 --> 00:01:17.461
profess the art of archery, in which I am such an adept, that I can drive my


13
00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:20.859
arrow through a hard stone; and besides this, I know many other valuable arts


14
00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:28.392
and mysteries.”Also, he says his previous employer did not pay him enough, so


15
00:01:28.392 --> 00:01:34.747
he quit, can’t blame him really... Well, his sales pitch alone is convincing


16
00:01:34.747 --> 00:01:41.927
enough. The King gives him the job as the guard of the royal palace One night,


17
00:01:41.927 --> 00:01:46.517
the king is walking around outside the palace. While he is on his stroll, he


18
00:01:46.517 --> 00:01:52.755
sees the sentinel on the lookout, standing on one leg (not this leg in the


19
00:01:52.755 --> 00:01:54.533
picture here, the artists involved making the picture overpainted it  but you


20
00:01:54.533 --> 00:01:59.700
get the idea). The king asks why he’s standing on one leg, and they get in a


21
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.172
little discussion over it. And then, while they were talking...


22
00:02:04.172 --> 00:02:07.232
A mysterious sound emerges from the forest! The king orders the sentinel to


23
00:02:07.232 --> 00:02:14.530
venture out into the woods to find the origins of this noise. Shortly after,


24
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.532
the king follows him at a cautious distance. The sentinel arrives to see a


25
00:02:20.532 --> 00:02:25.946
crying woman. The sentinel becomes infatuated with her, but there is a twist…


26
00:02:25.946 --> 00:02:31.360
she’s the soul of the king!  He asks her what it would take for her to stay.


27
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.892
She tells the sentinel that her soul is tied to the life of the king. As long


28
00:02:36.892 --> 00:02:42.452
as the king lives, she stays. But, the only way to prolong the king’s life


29
00:02:42.452 --> 00:02:49.486
requires the ultimate sacrifice… The Sentinel’s son! The sentinel runs home


30
00:02:49.486 --> 00:02:53.841
tells his son about his situation, and the son agrees to be sacrificed


31
00:02:53.841 --> 00:03:01.374
He brings his son the soul. The son, ready to be sacrificed, is


32
00:03:01.374 --> 00:03:05.728
still squinting in fear just before his father tries to cut his throat…  But


33
00:03:05.728 --> 00:03:11.025
then he stops the sentinel! The woman thinks that the sentinel and son’s


34
00:03:11.025 --> 00:03:16.321
display of their commitment is satisfying enough, there's no need for any bloodshed


35
00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:22.206
The sentinel and son are relieved. Afterwards, the sentinel returns to the


36
00:03:22.206 --> 00:03:26.679
palace. The sentinel returns, and the king confronts him. The king saw


37
00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:28.680
everything that had happened, and he is very pleased. As a result for his


38
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.565
convictions, the King shrouds the sentinel with gold, making the sentinel a


39
00:03:34.565 --> 00:03:39.626
very rich man. There is a bonus to this reward too: the sentinel is promoted


40
00:03:39.626 --> 00:03:44.098
to the keeper of the treasury! The parrot took all night to tell this tale.


41
00:03:44.098 --> 00:03:50.000
As a result, Kojihsteh spent all night listening to him, and is too tired to


42
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.337
venture out to see her lover

43
00:03:52.337 --> 00:03:55.750
and she passes out on the couch. The End!
