00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:10.216
As the sun was setting in the west and the moon was rising in the east.

2
00:00:10.915 --> 00:00:17.094
Khojisteh was filled with sadness, her eyes unable to contain any more tears; and unwilling

3
00:00:17.274 --> 00:00:22.424
to bear her heartache. It became clear to the Parrot just how apprehensive Khojisteh was.

4
00:00:22.944 --> 00:00:25.847
And he, as always distract her with a story.

5
00:00:27.787 --> 00:00:33.308
One day, while hunting, a nobleman happened to cross paths with a black snake in dismay.

6
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.109
Instantly the snake began pleading to the nobleman for some source of cover.

7
00:00:38.628 --> 00:00:43.068
The nobleman, as any curious person would ask why the snake was so rattled.

8
00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:46.767
The snake exclaimed with fear that there was a foe following him,

9
00:00:47.148 --> 00:00:49.596
and if the man caught him, he would take his life.

10
00:00:50.306 --> 00:00:55.149
The nobleman, seeing the fear in the snake, trusted him and gave the snake shelter in his sleeve.

11
00:00:55.828 --> 00:00:59.674
There, the snake could lay out of sight and protected from the man after him.

12
00:01:00.406 --> 00:01:06.457
Little did the nobleman know that the snake had been lying, that he all along was the foe in this tale.

13
00:01:07.623 --> 00:01:12.625
Moments later, a man came running with a stick, asking if anyone had seen a black snake.

14
00:01:13.313 --> 00:01:19.025
The man opening his hands up towards the nobleman as a way to express him pleading honestly for assistance.

15
00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:22.459
He explained that the snake had left and was seen heading this way.

16
00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:28.192
The nobleman trusting the vile snake responded no, so the man with the stick went on his way.

17
00:01:28.765 --> 00:01:32.029
As he became out of sight the nobleman asked the snake if

18
00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:35.208
he too was to go on his way, since the man with the stick had left.

19
00:01:35.685 --> 00:01:40.231
The snake explained to the nobleman that he had been surprisingly stupid trusting him.

20
00:01:40.782 --> 00:01:44.608
The snake went on, telling the nobleman that he was going to bite and kill him,

21
00:01:44.777 --> 00:01:47.649
and only when he is dead, then he will carry on his way.

22
00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:52.450
The nobleman, confused with this outcome, explained that he had helped the snake,

23
00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.173
doing all he could to allow him to cheat death.

24
00:01:55.428 --> 00:01:59.148
The nobleman continued, asking the snake why would he want to kill him?

25
00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:04.573
The snake then told the nobleman that “it is not right to do good to every person.”

26
00:02:05.156 --> 00:02:09.957
Gaining the sense of fear, the nobleman had decided to follow the mindset of the snake,

27
00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.702
in order get him out of his sleeve before his death.

28
00:02:12.945 --> 00:02:17.502
Putting his finger to his mouth, the nobleman tried to think of a convincing plan

29
00:02:17.502 --> 00:02:21.381
to save himself. He then decided to trick the snake in his sleeve and made

30
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:25.927
up a lie that there was another snake coming over. The Nobleman continued, convincing the

31
00:02:25.927 --> 00:02:30.007
snake that he should describe his plans to the other snake and only if that

32
00:02:30.007 --> 00:02:33.992
snake approves of his plan then he can treat the nobleman as seen fit.

33
00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:38.920
As the snake peers out of the sleeve to see, the nobleman concluded his plan

34
00:02:38.994 --> 00:02:42.675
as he struck the snake’s head with a stone, ultimately killing the snake.
