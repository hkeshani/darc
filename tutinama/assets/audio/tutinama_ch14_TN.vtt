00:00:05.136 --> 00:00:10.966
The Tutinama is a collection of stories, otherwise known as Tales of a Parrot, that

2
00:00:10.967 --> 00:00:15.936
is believed to be one of the earliest known Mughal transcripts. This story was 

3
00:00:15.937 --> 00:00:20.906
commissioned to be written by Akbar, the third ruler of the Mughal empire and a

4
00:00:20.907 --> 00:00:28.090
major player in the development of the Mughal style itself. The story is a frame

5
00:00:28.091 --> 00:00:33.168
narrative. The main story follows a woman called Khojisteh and her parrot who 

6
00:00:33.169 --> 00:00:38.138
tells her tales all night long to distract her from being unfaithful to her husband 

7
00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:45.808
who is abroad. On this particular evening when the skies are dark and Khojisteh

8
00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.480
is becoming restless, the parrot brings up the story of the syagoash, and

9
00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:57.531
Khojisteh demands to know the rest of the fascinating tale. The parrot tells her of

10
00:00:57.532 --> 00:01:03.527
a lion who lives in the desert and his friend, a monkey. The lion had to temporarily 

11
00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:09.901
leave his dwelling, and left the monkey to keep guard of it. While the lion was gone,

12
00:01:09.902 --> 00:01:15.465
a group of fiesty syagoash took a liking to his humble dwelling and decide to take it 

13
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:21.029
over, much to the monkey's dismay. Gesturing with his arms, the monkey explains

14
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.026
the lion will be returning soon and will not be pleased with them taking over his

15
00:01:25.027 --> 00:01:31.023
dwelling. Once the syagoash have discussed amongst one another, the male decides

16
00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:35.560
he will come up with a plan to deceive the lion and drive him away so they can keep

17
00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:42.853
the dwelling for themselves after all. As the lion returns down the sloping hill, the

18
00:01:42.854 --> 00:01:47.445
monkey concernedly warns him of the syagoash who have overtaken his dwelling, 

19
00:01:47.446 --> 00:01:55.007
and the lion fearfully decides to confront them. Once they see the lion coming, the

20
00:01:55.008 --> 00:02:00.085
syagoash come up with their plot to trick him. The male tells the female to quickly

21
00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:07.108
make all of their babies cry. As the lion is right near the entrance, he can hear the

22
00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:12.942
crying of the babies. The syagoash loudly announce that their babies are crying

23
00:02:12.943 --> 00:02:19.316
because they are so hungry for fresh lion meat, but not to worry because they had 

24
00:02:19.317 --> 00:02:25.096
heard a lion would be coming to the area for them to feast on. The lion hears this 

25
00:02:25.097 --> 00:02:30.282
and becomes very alarmed, and so he flees back to the monkey to tell him what 

26
00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:36.926
danger he is in. After the lion explains what happened, the monkey assures him that 

27
00:02:36.927 --> 00:02:42.328
the syagoash are only trying to trick him and that their words have absolutely no 

28
00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:49.135
merit. Trusting in his friend, the Lion decides to return once again to his dwelling.

29
00:02:52.646 --> 00:02:58.102
As the lion gingerly approaches, the same thing happens with the loud cries of the

30
00:02:58.103 --> 00:03:05.394
babies. The syagoash repeat their story, but this time they add in that their new

31
00:03:05.395 --> 00:03:11.283
'friend' the monkey has promised to help them trick the lion by assuring him he

32
00:03:11.284 --> 00:03:17.927
is safe and getting him to return to the dwelling. Hearing about this betrayal, The 

33
00:03:17.928 --> 00:03:23.923
lion becomes enraged. Forgetting about the dwelling and syagoash altogether, 

34
00:03:23.924 --> 00:03:31.810
he barrels toward the monkey. He grabs him and tears him to pieces. The lion 

35
00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:38.184
runs away from the dwelling, never to be seen again and the sneaky syagoash

36
00:03:38.185 --> 00:03:46.287
get their way. After the parrot finishes telling the story, he looks to Khojisteh and 

37
00:03:46.288 --> 00:03:54.174
says “Arise and go to your lover”. But The sun has begun to rise and the birds have

38
00:03:54.175 --> 00:04:00.926
begun to chirp. And Khojisteh realizes she cannot pursue a lover in the light of day, 

39
00:04:00.927 --> 00:04:08.003
for she might get caught, so she stays in her home. Yet again, the parrot has 

40
00:04:08.004 --> 00:04:14.863
prevented her from being unfaithful to her husband. But How many more nights will

41
00:04:14.864 --> 00:04:17.510
he be able to distract Khojisteh?
