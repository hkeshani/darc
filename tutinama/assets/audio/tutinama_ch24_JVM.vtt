00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:12.725
A. Hello and welcome to between two betel trees, with us today, from the book the Tooti-nama.

2
00:00:12.725 --> 00:00:16.450
The tales of a parrot, that is, the TutiNameh without a hyphen.

3
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:23.450
TutiNama. I wouldn’t know, Gladwin… blame him he is the guy who translated this.

4
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:30.450
A. I am Areca, and with us today, is he who held Khojisteh from committing adultery night after night,

5
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.000
with his gift of storytelling, none other than the teller himself, Parrot,reincarnated into Parrot.

6
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.567
P. Yeah thanks. I am honored to be here.

7
00:00:39.567 --> 00:00:42.450
A. 52 nights you tricked her.

8
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.325
P. It used to be 70 something in the old days.

9
00:00:45.325 --> 00:00:47.554
A. The ancient Sanskrit Version right.

10
00:00:47.554 --> 00:00:53.499
P. Yea, rumor has it that Emperor Akbar was pretty much illiterate. This reduced version Nakhshabi

11
00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:59.072
wrote in, Persian Arabic, he couldn’t read any of it. So he got his henchmen he kept in the KitabKhana

12
00:00:59.072 --> 00:01:02.800
to draw the stories in comic book from.

13
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.394
A. Right to left… Everyone knows that… I’m glad I wasn’t a Calligrapher or Illustrator back then.

14
00:01:09.394 --> 00:01:11.531
So why down to just 52?

15
00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:17.450
P. Its because 70 attempts seemed a desperate for a woman to try to see her secret lover

16
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.076
52 makes it more believable I guess?

17
00:01:20.076 --> 00:01:23.326
A. Munchies*, you want some Paan man? P. Nah spit that somewhere far away from me…

18
00:01:23.326 --> 00:01:28.450
A. Well let’s take a look at some of your best moments shall we? … What tale did you tell here.

19
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:35.772
P. Oh yeaa I remember this one, it was the 24th night. Khojisteh has asked me how her lover needs to

20
00:01:35.772 --> 00:01:39.000
prove his intelligence to her. And I’m like listen,

21
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.575
tell him this tale and if he figures it out he cant be that stupid. so I tell her this.

22
00:01:46.575 --> 00:01:52.692
P. Once upon a time, the son of the king of Babylon, he gets a turban. A golden turban.

23
00:01:52.692 --> 00:02:01.450
And nice clothes. A. No skin?. Are you crazy he’s royalty, we dignify him with clothes.

24
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.528
And a Katar dagger, he needs one of those. He probably has one of those. Every prince has one of those.

25
00:02:05.528 --> 00:02:14.909
A. Three out of Five poppies. P. Its like a custom ****** gold Iphone. He wont kill anyone with it, its just for show.

26
00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.624
So he walks into this temple of this idol. Gold head to toe.

27
00:02:18.624 --> 00:02:22.618
This is divinity we’re talking about. He's just chilling in this shrine.

28
00:02:22.618 --> 00:02:26.426
And nearby he sees this beautiful woman, her face bright as the moon,

29
00:02:26.426 --> 00:02:32.450
hair as dark as the darkest of nights, her body Erect like the Cypress tree,

30
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.386
her walk as Graceful as the pheasants. And he was like  “ahhrrgh I love her so much

31
00:02:37.386 --> 00:02:40.729
I swear ill chop off my head if I ever marry her"

32
00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:44.400
turns to the idol and goes “ I would sacrifice it to you”

33
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.160
Well guess what they get married somewhere nice and together with a Brahmin,

34
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.950
A. Interesting clothing of choice, Just a casual cloth vibe going on here. Bare chested?

35
00:02:54.950 --> 0:02:57.578
yea, no he... He is of a lower status. He’s like a trusted companion of the prince.

36
00:02:57.578 --> 00:03:02.172
Right! We give him… 2 out of… infinite dimensions.

37
00:03:02.172 --> 00:03:07.467
P. So they travel back to his father-in-laws house and they pass that same temple,

38
00:03:07.467 --> 00:03:11.925
the prince remembers his vow and chops off his head drops it by the idol.

39
00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:19.169
The Brahmin finds him, and is like “sh#t they’ll think I killed him”.

40
00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:22.792
chops his head and drops it by the idol. The Wife finds…

41
00:03:22.792 --> 00:03:28.179
A. Hold on we’re loving the jewels and beautiful blue dress, 10 out of 15...

42
00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:32.450
oh my, her face. What happened? P. Marriage happened.

43
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:43.783
P. Yea, so she finds them both, and she’s like “***** it. I am done, I can’t find another man now...

44
00:03:43.783 --> 00:03:49.450
P. The idol raises its hands, when she’s just about to do it,

45
000:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.077
the idol tells her to just reattach the heads and they’ll be fine.

46
00:03:53.077 --> 00:03:57.700
I'm an idol, i can make stuff like this happen. Simple enough, ehy?

47
00:03:57.077 --> 00:04:00.322
A. She mixes up the heads. Nooo Haha

48
00:04:00.322 --> 00:04:05.709
P. Totally, yup. Haha. They’re alive again, they each look at the wife,

49
00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.000
and say: That’s mine…. A. Right  P. The question is who’s got the

50
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.700
legitimate claim to the wife? The head does, "because it’s the seat

51
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.130
of wisdom and presides over body". If khosjisteh's lover can answer that correctly,

52
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.582
he might not be as ***** as he looks. A. Meditate on that one for min. We love it.

53
00:04:24.582 --> 00:04:26.700
But you know, by the time she wanted to leave, morning had already broken.

54
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.700
Khojisteh once again not the right kind of cock crowing she had wished for that

55
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:37.053
morning all thanks to parrot here. Join us, next time on “first we betelnut”,

56
00:04:37.053 --> 00:04:43.555
where we discuss how much we don’t care about perspective when drawing miniatures. And

57
00:04:43.555 --> 00:04:49.272
if anyone thinks they look like ****. It has been a pleasure, until next time.

58
00:04:49.272 --> 00:05:03.700
Mumbling*
