00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.000
The Tutinama is a collection of stories that was illustrated during the Mughal reign of

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.450
Akbar in the 16th century. Akbar used this project to blend Indian, Islamic, and Persian

3
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.000
artistic styles of Central and Western Asia. While Indo-Persian painting styles were 

4
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.000
active in Mughal courts before the Tutinama, Akbar’s efforts are notable in the 

5
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.650
development and unification of distinct Mughal artistic and aesthetic style. 

6
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.000
One day, a rich Iranian merchant leaves on a business trip. His wife Khojisteh is bored at 

7
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.450
home and wants to indulge in a love affair to pass the time. One night she goes to 

8
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:46.000
her Parrot who says, “I will send you to your lover but first the story of the King and 

9
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.798
his daughter.” Let us begin in the King’s court. The King sits on a throne 

10
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:57.450
a central and elevated position. The surrounding figures in his line of sight have bowed

11
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.108
heads while other figures are occupied providing him shade or assistance highlighting 

12
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.000
their subservience. The King wears an elaborate and bright orange robe and is the only 

13
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.950
figure with a feather in his turban which highlights his distinguished, authoritative, and 

14
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.450
regal position. Across the illustrations, figures of higher rank and within court 

15
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.450
positions wear long white sashes around the waist like a decorative belt. The males within 

16
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.450
court wear sashes with red and black stripes, including the King. In contrast, the only 

17
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.450
figure that does not wear a belt is the Dervish, highlighting his lowly, outsider status. 

18
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.500
A Dervish is a devotee who takes vows of poverty and austerity in the Sufi Muslim faith. 

19
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.800
These belts could signify collective identity, membership, and even rank within the royal 

20
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.500
court. The King had a daughter who was all fairness and beauty. One day, a 

21
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.450
Dervish saw the daughter and fell mad with love and passion. He went to the King and said 

22
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.450
‘I must have your daughter.’The King, you can imagine, was livid. He called to 

23
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:10.450
his advisor, “How dare someone so poor think he can have my daughter! Punish him.” Here 

24
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.150
the King is standing and is drawing his sword in what appears to be a challenge to a dual. 

25
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.450
The King and his mace bearer are lunging forward which creates a sense of motion and 

26
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.186
urgency. In contrast, the Dervish is chained around his neck and carries no weapons. He is 

27
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.450
wearing very little clothing and no shoes. The clothing he does wear has a very muted 

28
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.450
brown and grey color palette. His head covering is leopard print and is one piece rather a 

29
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.450
wrapped turban.  These contrasts to the King’s bright, ornate robes highlight a stark 

30
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.600
difference social position and authority. “Perhaps I can get him to leave the city some 

31
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:58.200
other way?” The King agrees to the plan and the advisor calls for the lovesick Dervish.

32
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:05.000
“You know that there must be some kind of exchange. It’s just how these marriages go. If 

33
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.800
you can bring an elephant load of gold, the king’s daughter is yours.” 

34
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:20.150
The Dervish looks around ‘I have no gold, but people talk of the generosity of the Prince 

35
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.700
of Princes. Simply ask for what you need, and he will bestow it on you.”

36
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.450
He goes to the Prince who listens to his case. “This seems like a worthy cause. Here’s the 

37
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.450
gold. Good luck.” And the Dervish returns to the King.  

38
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:45.450
the King sighed, “Well, this did not go according to plan.” “Well done!” says the 

39
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.950
advisor, “But now the king needs the head of the Prince of Princes!”

40
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.450
The Dervish returns and pleads with the Prince “He now wants your head! What am I to do? 

41
00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.450
This woman is all I can think of – I need her.” “Calm down, 

42
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:10.180
I have a plan. See, I normally carry my head in my hand. Tie me up and carry me before 

43
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:17.000
court. When they consent, make a show of cutting my head from my body. I will deal with 

44
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.100
them if they pull any more tricks.” And so, the duo set off to court. 

45
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.800
When they arrive, the King sees the generosity of the Prince and is amazed. “Surely, 

46
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.750
there is no greater, wiser, or stronger man! For who would willingly give their head for 

47
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:43.200
an unworthy person?! You would make a great match with my daughter!” and the King gives his daughter 

48
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:51.000
over to Prince of Princes. The King and the Prince wear similar necklaces with large black 

48
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.021
and gold adornments. In contrast to the surrounding figures, the Prince is the only one

49
00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:01.450
whose eye gaze is slightly above the King of Bahilistan. He is also one of the only 

50
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.450
characters without a weapon and yet the King determines that he is strong and powerful, 

51
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.450
quickly ceding authority and his daughter’s hand in marriage. The narrative and 

52
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.923
illustration highlight that the Prince has particular and self-evident influence over the 

53
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.450
King.   

54
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.450
“And now, my sweet Khojisteh, the story is over,” Says the Parrot.

55
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.450
“Do the Dervish and the daughter end up together?” She asks. 

56
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:35.300
“Ah, I don't know that. You should go see your friend. He has been waiting for quite some 

57
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:41.000
time.” Khojisteh goes to leave but morning has come, and her love affair is delayed 

58
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.000
another night.
