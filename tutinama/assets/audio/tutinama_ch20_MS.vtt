00:09.000 --> 00:14.000 vertical:rl
<v In the previous research assignment, I studied the 20th chapter and the corresponding paintings of the Tutinama tales.
2
00:17.000 --> 00:23.000 vertical:rl
<v In this chapter, Tutinama, The parrot, tells Khojesteh a story about a woman who to escape
3
00:24.000 --> 00:32.000 vertical:rl
<v consequences from her husband ran into the desert along with her two children. It is here that they come across a
4
00:32.000 --> 00:40.000 vertical:rl
<v Lion. The mother, being the good mother that she is, offers her two children to the lion as sacrifice and asks that in
5
00:41.000 --> 00:54.000 vertical:rl
<v exchange the lion must never return to this part of the desert and she would be free. The lion, having no place to flee too decided
6
00:54.000 --> 00:63.000 vertical:rl
<v to let them all go. The woman and her two children then returned home, and she remained an, “obedient
7
00:64.000 --> 00:69.000 vertical:rl
<v wife” for the rest of her days, a rather misogynistic term expression but it was the 16th century.
8
00:69.000 --> 00:81.000 vertical:rl
<v This chapter has two corresponding paintings although the lion is painted as a leopard. In
9
00:82.000 --> 00:88.000 vertical:rl
<v the first painting we can see the woman walking with her 2 children and in the top right hand corner you can
10
00:88.000 --> 00:99.000 vertical:rl
<v see a leopard. the leopard in this painting appears to be eyeing down the family, and in the second painting the family
11
00:99.000 --> 00:105.000 vertical:rl
<v Lying consistent with the story told by tutinama
12
00:105.000 --> 00:113.000 vertical:rl
<v The artist of this painting used colour intensity to demonstrate distance. Paintings
13
00:113.000 --> 00:119.000 vertical:rl
<v By comparing the colour intensity between the first and second paintings we can see that the second painting
14
00:119.000 --> 00:128.000 vertical:rl
<v has higher intensity, and furthermore; that the proximity between the family and the leopard is much smaller
15
00:128.000 --> 00:134.000 vertical:rl
<v in the second painting. This means that the paintings with lower colour intensity, such as the first one
16
00:134.000 --> 00:146.000 vertical:rl
<v are used to represent larger distances, and the paintings with high colour intensity represent shorter distances.
17
00:146.000 --> 00:155.000 vertical:rl
<v It is likely that the artists who painted these paintings used colour intensity to represent distance.
18
00:156.000 --> 00:165.000 vertical:rl
<v as three-dimensional painting techniques were not introduced until 18th-20th centuries during
19
00:165.000 --> 00:168.000 vertical:rl
<v the British Colonial Period. Now lets focus our attention towards the physical expressions on the woman, and her children.
20
00:168.000 --> 00:178.000 vertical:rl
<v both scenes, The mother however; seems to hold a rather calm temperament despite facing the lion.
21
00:180.000 --> 00:186.000 vertical:rl
<v the children however, look distressed one thing you'll notice, is that there seems to be an
22
00:187.000 --> 00:195.000 vertical:rl
<v Incongruity between the facial and bodily expressions, made by the children. In both paintings
23
00:195.000 --> 00:203.000 vertical:rl
<v the children seem to be distressed if you look at their bodily expressions. However, their smiling
24
00:203.000 --> 00:212.000 vertical:rl
<v as they look at their mother? This stems from a mughal painting technique. The facial expressions made by
25
00:212.000 --> 219.000 vertical:rl
<v the individuals are not representative of emotion but rather but rather demonstrate that they are in conversation.
26
00:220.000 --> 00:226.000 vertical:rl
<v Now lets take a look at the woman in the first photo if we zoom in on her hand. We can see that she is
27
00:227.000 --> 00:234.000 vertical:rl
<v Making a gesture, and this gesture is suggesting that she is calm considering that she remains calm throughout
28
00:235.000 --> 00:243.000 vertical:rl
<v the entire ordeal. This would lie consitent with the story told by Tutinama.
29
00:244.000 --> 00:248.000 vertical:rl
<v Now let’s look at the leopard in the second painting.
30
00:252.000 --> 00:260.000 vertical:rl
<v You will notice, that he has a fox tied onto his leg. Nowhere in the story told by Tutinama
31
00:261.000 --> 00:269.000 vertical:rl
<v Does a fox appear. However, the artist thought it important to add a fox into the painting.
32
00:270.000 --> 00:279.000 vertical:rl
<v The paintings title states that the fox is egging the leopard on in his attempts to feed on the family.
33
00:279.000 --> 00:287.000 vertical:rl
<v This is indicative of the shared fight against hunger that all animals face. By representing the
34
00:287.000 --> 00:293.000 vertical:rl
<v animals as a single entity it becomes clear that the artist's intentions were not only to create
35
00:293.000 --> 00:302.000 vertical:rl
<v a shared relationship between the animals. But also to demonstrate the dangers that lie within the desert.
36
00:304.000 --> 00:313.000 vertical:rl
<v As far as we know these are the original forms of these paintings,  but unfortunately it is
37
00:313.000 --> 00:322.000 vertical:rl
<v difficult to guarantee. Recent research conducted by John Seyler showed that many of the paintings
38
00:322.000 --> 00:327.000 vertical:rl
<v Within the manuscript have been the manuscript, have been painted over. This it due to
39
00:327.000 --> 00:332.000 vertical:rl
<v unusually thick layers of paint, as well as spots that lack pignementation likely due to bleeding.
40
00:333.000 --> 00:341.000 vertical:rl
<v This unfortunate information means that some of the paintings are in fact unoriginal
41
00:341.000 --> 350.000 vertical:rl
<v Though it is impossible to say with absolute certainty that the paintings discussed today are original.
42
00:351.000 --> 00:361.000 vertical:rl
<v And furthermore, what the originals would look like. It adds to the mystery, and the history surrounding
43
00:361 --> 00:365.000 vertical:rl
<v The Tales of The Tutinama manuscript.
