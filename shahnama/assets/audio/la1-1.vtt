Well hello there my curious fellow students, do you have a moment to talk about Jesu… ahem… an ancient oriental love story from Shahnameh?

2
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.500
Shah na what you ask? Shahnameh I say. 

3
00:00:026.500 --> 00:00:33.450
Also known as the Persian Book of Kings, it is one of the most popular creations in the history of Islamic art and literature.

4
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Similar to other epics of the world, the Persian Book of Kings features many love stories involving legendary characters.

5
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.000
Among these epic stories is the tale of Shirin and Khusraw.

6
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.500
This illustration from Isfahan, now stored in the National Library of France 

7
00:00:51.550 --> 00:01:00.000
captures the scene in which Shirin talks to Khusraw on top of her castle after a long time of heartbreaking separation.

8
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:08.450
The story begins when Khusraw was no longer “the fearless young man who had cherished Shirin more than his own sight”.  

9
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.200
He preoccupied himself with travels, hunts and his battles with Bahram;  

10
00:01:13.500 -->  00:01:19.200
leaving Shirin in solitude, weeping for days and nights for their lost love.

11
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:30.800
*MUSIC* Ahem… anyways one day he decided to hop on his horse and go on a hunt. 

12
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It was so grand that thousands of soldiers, hounds, servants and musicians marched with Khusraw.

13
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.100
There were even two hundred slaves and two hundred young servants travelling ahead the group

14
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.000
to scatter water so wind would not stir up the dust and disturb king Parviz. 

15
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:56.000
I wish I was that rich. News of the hunt soon reached Shirin, as expected who lives alone in her castle. 

16
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
After hearing about Khusraw’s approaching,

17
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.000
Shirin, as you can see, surrounded by her handmaidens, put on her “golden dress scented with musk,

18
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and over it a surcoat of red Byzantine brocade with a gold ground worked with jewels”.

19
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000
She also “made her cheeks the color of pomegranates”, is it how it's pronounced?

20
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
which isn’t really visible here for some reason,

21
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
probably because the translation I used is done hundreds of years after,

22
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.900
and “on her head she placed a crown of imperial splendor”,

23
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.000
as it is shown clearly in this illustration.

24
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.900
When Khusraw finally arrived, Shirin, as the beauty with moon-shaped face

25
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.900
and fair complexion in this image, cried, of course. 

26
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I don’t know about you but I know I probably would go down and punch him and move on

27
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
if I was wearing her shoes after years of ignoring.

28
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
with tears running down her cheek Shirin asked Khusraw: 

29
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.900
“Oh my lord, my warrior, my king,” “Where is your love now?” Yeah, where were you dude?

30
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:12.000
Annnd upon hearing this, deeply moved, Khusraw cried as well. He hurried back to finish his hunting…

31
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.900
wait what? I thought he learnt from his mistakes. And what kind of guy plans

32
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.900
a hunting trip passing his love of life’s castle without knowing after ignoring her for so long?

33
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:32.900
*SUPER UNBERABLE LOUD MUSIC* That’s the last one, I promise.

34
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.900
Annnd finally he come back and married Shirin and sent her to his harem. 

35
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:47.000
What a story! Now, according to the research I’ve done, I know, I know, you all only wanted the story part

36
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
but hey, at least you can share this as fun facts on your next date… 

37
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
seriously don’t do that. Anyways, there are two major types of illustrated Persian manuscripts, 

38
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
one is picture focused, the other text focused. 

39
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
This one here clearly belongs to the former. The whole image is done in a two dimensional fashion,

40
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
but if you zoom in on the balcony where Shirin stands, you could clearly see

41
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
the space behind it indicating the artist’s three dimensional imagination.

42
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Also, if you take a second look here, she looks rather emotionless in this picture;

43
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:30.000
even her servants look sadder than her with their brows bending downwards, 

44
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
which makes it kind of odd and funny I guess.

45
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.500
My theory is that the artist may be trying to portray her as the classic beautiful perfect woman

46
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.500
and enforce this idea in the image.

47
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.000
And that is everything I got for you guys today,

48
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
hopefully you liked it and have a wonderful day.
