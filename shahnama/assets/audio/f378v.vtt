00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:12.480
Nushirvan, Sháh of Iran is known for his righteous rule and fair treatment of his

2
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:21.860
subjects. He graciously welcomes the envoy of the Indian Rája, who arrives with a thousand

3
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:30.000
camels and gifts. Nushirvan and his courtiers are well pleased with the presentation of the

4
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:40.310
horses and the gifts are taken to the royal treasury.The Rája

5
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:48.430
of Hind sent his envoy to Nurshirvan with the most important gift of them all:

6
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.620
the game of CHESS, challenging the Iranians to figure out the name of each piece

7
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.500
and the nature of the game. If they fail to figure it out the Sháh

8
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.600
will have to pay a tribute unto the Rája, “since knowledge is of all famed

9
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.000
things the best.” If they do figure it out, the Rája will then have to send full

10
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:30.990
tribute to the Sháh’s court with all good will. Nushirvan is seated on a red

11
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:42.020
carpet with intricate white designs. On his head sits a red royal headpiece covered in

12
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:51.450
white, gold, and red gems. He is cloaked in a deep blue robe that is

13
00:01:50.960 --> 00:02:00.710
secured by a gold wrap around his waist. Nushirvan stands out in this image as

14
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:12.700
someone special like an eagle amidst crows. The men and chiefs all examine the chessboard,

15
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:21.150
trying every device and playing it with one another in all possible ways. Yet none

16
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:33.240
can figure it out. UNTIL Buzurjmihr finds Nushirvan troubled. He makes a promise to Nushirvan,

17
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:43.640
“O great king, I will discover all this goodly game, employing wisdom as my guide therein”

18
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:53.670
And so he did in one day and night. Nushirvan happily called upon all people,

19
00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:03.840
including the envoy to watch the game finally be played. Two women are outside peering

20
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.710
over the balcony into the room filled with men as if a mother is patiently

21
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:19.250
overlooking the life of her children while the game is being played. Tension filled the room

22
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:31.790
until the game was successfully complete. The whole assembly was in awe. The Indian envoy

23
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:40.060
was alone among the Iranians as if underscoring his defeat in solving the game.
