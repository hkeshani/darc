00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:10.900
This picture is called “Kayumars enthroned”. Here, we see at the center of the photo, Kayumars.


2
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:19.166
The King of Kings. Sitting above everyone upon his red throne, he reigns above everyone and everything.


3
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:24.324
Believed to be the first man alive according to ancient Iranian Zionists beliefs,

4
00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:28.788
he is compared to and may be synonymous to Adam as the first man

5
00:00:28.788 --> 00:00:32.950
as the majority of the current Iranian population is now Muslim.

6
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.460
Being the king of kings. He is not only the king of humans

7
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.405
He is the king of all beings. Even animals submit to him.

8
00:00:42.405 --> 00:00:50.459
In his presence, they are calm. Interacting freely between each other. Adorned with garms of leopards

9
00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:56.168
His followers do not stand up straight but in a hunched position as a form of respect.

10
00:00:56.168 --> 00:01:01.290
By his side, sits his son, the young, Siyamak.

11
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.820
Together they lived a peaceful life upon their mountaintop home

12
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.433
But one day, the Angel Surush appeared. He warn him Kayumar that he, has a challenger.

13
00:01:12.433 --> 00:01:20.420
Not to far away from him the evil div or as you would say now,Demon Ahiram opposes his rule.

14
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:28.700
He we see the black div Ahirm. Reigning over his respective mountain. Dominating his peak.

15
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:36.600
In relation to Kayumars, like a dark cloud he is hovering over him. A dark omen foretelling what is to come

16
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:45.700
From the information Kayumars is shocked, but his son, the young wild Siyamak. He is enraged.

17
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.905
He gathers his brothers and sisters and forms a war party to climb up to the mountain and slay the treacherous Ahiram

18
00:01:50.715 --> 00:01:53.905
and slay the treacherous Ahiram

19
00:01:53.905 --> 00:02:02.252
Here we see a vicious young leopard attacking; coming face to face to face with the demon Ahiram.

20
00:02:02.252 --> 00:02:07.666
His teeth are bare, yet there is an obvious difference in power.

21
00:02:07.666 --> 00:02:15.329
The demon Ahiram stands above him and is larger and therefore has the “upper hand” in this battle.


22
00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:21.617
This young leopard resembles Siyamak. Adorned in his leopard pelt.

23
00:02:21.617 --> 00:02:24.663
Preparing to battle the powerful demon


24
00:02:24.663 --> 00:02:31.555
Upon meeting this vicious demon, Siyamak by his lonesome attacks the evil div.



25
00:02:31.555 --> 00:02:40.155
Entangled in a vicious grappling match, he is ultimately bested by the powerful demon and so the evil Ahiram

26
00:02:40.155 --> 00:02:47.920
mounted upon the young Siyamak, impales him with his black claws and rips him from head to toe.


27
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.635
Broken and shocked by the overwhelming loss of their  leader,

28
00:02:52.635 --> 00:02:59.000
 Siyamaks troops withdraw and returns to Kayumars mountain to tell him of what just occurred


29
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.210
Upon hearing the news; Overcome by grief, Kayumars wails in pain.

29
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:11.797
With his nails, tearing his face and body apart, he is heartbroken



30
00:03:11.797 --> 00:03:20.370
That day, everyone cried. Cheeks were red as wine making tears look as if they were blood.



31
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:32.276
Even Kayumars Beasts could be heard crying in anguish. The once peaceful mountain was now filled with mourning .


32
00:03:32.276 --> 00:03:43.276
and so one year had passed, and the Angel Suresh returned. Carrying the message of God, he tells Kayumars


33
00:03:43.276 --> 00:03:47.488
“return to that mountain once again and eliminate that vile div


34
00:03:47.488 --> 00:03:52.490
Turn him to dust and eliminate the vengeance form your heart”

35
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.108
That day, Kayumars stopped crying.

36
00:03:56.108 --> 00:04:08.450
He wiped his tears and prepared his counterattack for the being who stole his most blessed son from him.
