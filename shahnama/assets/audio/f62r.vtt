00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
The Shahnameh is an epic that encompasses the history of ancient Persian kings from the beginning of time

2
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
all the way to the advent of Islam. Meant to celebrate the ideals of Persian kingship, there are a

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
multitude of stories within the text that accomplish this goal. The story which relates to our image here

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
is not so much a celebration of kingship but it is rather a lesson on  the importance of humility and faith through the

5
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
example of a king blinded by his own ambition. In our illustration , we are dealing with the story of how the

6
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
Shah Kay Kavus becomes tricked into flying to the heavens. One day, the Shah is tempted by the

7
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
words of a div, disguised as a beautiful youth, to expand his kingdom from the Earth to the heavens. Kay Kavus

8
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
is moved so much by the flattery of the beautiful youth that he decides to build a flying device that will take him to the sky.

9
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
The flying device, a true example of the Shah’s flawed ingenuity, was made by attaching eagles, fed to be as strong

10
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
as lions, to each corner of a throne. The Shah then had spears bound to each corner of the throne as

11
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
well, with lamb legs skewered onto these spear heads. As such, through the power of the strong eagles flying

12
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
towards these pieces of meat, the King was lifted with his throne from the ground and towards the sky.

13
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
Within the painting, the placement of the Shah and his flying device in the centre immediately draws the observer’s attention.

14
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
The device could be thought of as an extension to the King’s character. It is ornate in detail and its engineering is flawed,

15
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
similar to the King’s regal but flawed character. He has taken a seemingly impossible task to expand his kingdom to the heavens

16
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
using a flying device that will ultimately fail him. In the time that his device does work, the Shah is able to reach his destination only temporarily.

17
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
Displayed in a moment of action, we see Kay Kavus aiming his bow and arrow at a fish held by an angel.

18
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
The divine location of this scene is indicated by the background of the blue sky and golden clouds encircling the Shah and the angel.

19
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
The use of these rich colours makes this moment of action feel alive and vivid.

20
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
In addition, it asserts a religious context to the scene. The blue and gold colour of the background is

21
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
analogous to examples of the gold-written text of the Quran on blue backgrounds.

22
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
Applying this analogy to the illustration, it reinforces the religious context to the scene and related story.

23
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
Blinded by his own ambition, it could be argued that the Shah had forgotten his faith,

24
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
not seeing the folly in his attempt to conquer the heavens, the domain of the very God he worships.

25
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
Eventually his eagles grow tired of flying his throne and he descends upon a forest far away.

26
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
In the translated text we see that Kay Kavus grows remorseful of his actions.

27
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
The Shah “tarried in the wood in shame and grief, imploring from Almighty God relief.”

28
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
The lesson of the story is thus delivered as Kay Kavus returns to his senses and remembers the importance of his faith, feeling humility for his actions.

29
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
feeling humility for his actions.
