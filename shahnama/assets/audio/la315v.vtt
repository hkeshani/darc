00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.530
Battlegrounds were not an unordinary sight between the Ancient Persian Empire and the Byzantine Empire 

2
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.000
in the Shahnama in the 17th century. The battle between the armies of Shapur and 

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.220
Rum was not an exception. The almighty Ancient Persian King Shah Ardshir passed and left

4
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.000
the throne to his promising son, Shah Shapur, who acted quickly in place of his

5
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
father to engage in the battle in Palawina with the Romans. Shapur sent off his  

6
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
most powerful fighter, Garshap the Lion, to fight against the Roman’s prized fighter sent by 

7
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.600
Caesar, named Bazanush. The fight between the two strong, eager hosts was brutal and never-ending, 

8
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.000
as both were equal in strength. In an epic battle, as we see a soldier

9
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.500
beheaded, “ … heaven shook; the earth rocked, and the air Was full of dust, the war-spears 

10
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.500
gleamed like fire, And all the men of wisdom called on God.” Shapur could not

11
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.000
take it anymore, and stepped in to gang up on Bazanush and took him captive. 

12
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Ten thousand Romans were killed and sixteen hundred more were taken prisoner. The Ancient Persians  

13
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.500
and Shah Shapur won the battle, raising their flag high, having defeated Caesar and the Roman 

14
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.000
Empire. As a last resort to save him and his Empire’s grace, Caesar sent an 

15
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.500
envoy to Shapur. He asks Shapur how many people he will murder in the name 

16
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.500
of wealth and fame, and what it would require to stop him from continuing battle

17
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.000
on his grounds, in an attempt to seek remorse from the new king. Shapur, proud

18
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.600
of his battle winnings, left the battle in Palawina only after Caesar sent him ten

19
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:53.000
ox-hides of dinars, a thousand female and male Roman slaves, and countless pieces of beautiful

20
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
brocade to use for dress. With his new riches, Shapur journeyed to the Ahwaz village 

21
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
where he built his city, naming it ‘Shapur Gird’. On the day of Ard, which 

22
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
is ironically the Zoroastrian day of making amends to someone for loss, Shapur finished the

23
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
city and filled its inhabitants with the slaves Caesar sent. The beautiful city Shapur built

24
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.410
was within the district of Khuzistan, the old citadel, on the great highway where all

25
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29:410
can be seen and everything passes. But Shapur did not stop at building one city.

26
00:02:29:410 --> 00:02:34.440
He built himself his own city, which was said to be fair and wealthy, without 

27
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.860
the burden of forced labour. A body of water split Shapur’s city though, and he

28
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.500
was in need of a bridge to be able to cross over it. Never ridding


00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.140
of Bazanush, Shapur made a deal with the prisoner, who Shapur took great care of. 

30
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.290
In return for eternal safety and companionship from Shapur and anything desired in his wealthy 

31
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.500
treasury, Bazanush was to build a bridge over the body of water and employ the

32
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.700
new inhabitants of Shapur’s city in the engineering project. Bazanush took this offer, and got

33
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:15.000
to work. After three long years, Bazanush and those he employed finished the great bridge.

34
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.600
As Shapur promised, Bazanush received whatever he wished for, which was to 

35
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.000
go home to his family and continue his life. Shah Shapur remained 

36
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
strong and just in his counsel and his throne remained unmoved for years to come.
