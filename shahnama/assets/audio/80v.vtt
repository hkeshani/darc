The Fire Ordeal of Siyavush, a celebrated Persian literary hero.

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.450

Entice the young prince which her sexual advances,

9
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.000
but Siyavush would not give in to these adulterous romances.

10
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.100
Enraged by rejection of her affection, she demands conviction with the use of fabrication


11
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.100
of lies against the prince, who touched and probed and molested the mistress,

12
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.450
Sudaba now demands that Siyavush be taken out of existence

13
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.100
Like the ashes in the wind, word gets back to the king.


14
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.950
Upon hear the false deeds committed by his son,

15
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.450

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.450
Whilst the fabricated assault against his wife cause the Shah a great deal of strife.

17
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.450
To end the suffering and gain the innocence he aspires, Siyavush demands to endure...


18
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.000
the Ordeal of Fire.

19
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.350
Conquer the flames that smoke the sky a greyness of lead,


20
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.100
and burn the land a scorching, murderous red. Charge into the heat, only innocence can beat,


21
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.500
to emerge victorious is to be righteous.

22
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.450
The people of the city lookout, rooting for the young prince,

23
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.550
he enters the fires, for this ordeal will convince…

24
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.950
He cannot be seen, oh no their prince is lost. His misdeeds against Sudaba, his life was the cost


25
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.450
But alas, at the edge, what do they observe, a silhouette of life,

26
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.450
could the Siyavush be preserved.

27
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.450
When all unsmirched, unsinged, unstained, unled, the guiltless Siyawush approached, his sire

28
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.450
All rejoice and celebrate for innocence is claimed by undergoing the Ordeal of Fire.

29
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.450
Our mighty hero emerges, on his black steed he rides,


30
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.450
Untouched by the flame, unfazed by Sudaba’s lies.


31
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.450
The people cheer, over and over, for their prince is alive

32
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.450
and thank the god for allowing good to survive

33
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.450
The prince triumphs, and all crimes dissolved,


34
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.450
thought the matter of Sudaba and her lies is yet to be resolved.

35
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.450
Sudaba watches from the window, her sins now her own,

36
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.450
the decision is to be disowned, stripped of her thrown.

37
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.000
Luckily Sudaba’s blood was not destined to bleed…….


38
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.000
As Siyavush rode in on his valiant steed. No father please do not give her death



39
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.450
I beg, I pled, I allow her breath, and thus the Shah ultimately declared


40
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.450
That Sudaba’s life be spared


41
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.450
Alas Siyavush rode out the fire and into our hearts

42
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.450
Caused by wrongful desire, and his story imparts that lies are wrongful and will receive justice



43
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:21.450
A flame separates innocence from corruptness. Just like our image the fire burns bright



44
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.950
Thou not as strongly as Siyavush, a godlily light. Positioned in front, the center of sight



45
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.450
The portray itself, deems him to be right.


46
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.450
Thus ends the tale of Siyavush and the Ordeal of Fire

47
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.200
but its tellings and retellings deserved to be remembered

48
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.450
