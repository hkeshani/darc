Gardens in the Islamic world, especially ones mentioned in classic stories, were often places filled with 

2
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
music and song. In the 13th-century Arabic story, Bayad and Riyad, a young man and woman cleverly flirt 

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
with each other in a social gathering by singing passionate songs to one another. They are in a palace 

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
garden surrounded by people, but this does not stop them.

5
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
The story unfolds in the palace of an important official in Andalusia, Spain, where Muslim courts ruled. 

6
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
The official’s daughter is the lady of the household, and she feels very protective of her female servants 

7
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
and their honour.

8
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
As the noblewoman is offered wine, she surveys her servants and notices that their eyes are fixed 

9
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
adoringly on a handsome young man named Bayad, who is visiting from Damascus. He plays an oud, a 

10
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
stringed Middle Eastern instrument similar to a guitar.

11
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
Bayad had already fallen in love with one of the young women in the group. It was love at first sight, and 

12
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
her name was Riyad. A song about piercing eyes and desire had just finished when Bayad was invited to 

13
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
sing. The song he performed included the lines: “Love holds absolute power over my soul, A power that would make the hardest iron melt.”

14
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
Courtyard palace gardens, like the one pictured here, were a popular feature in the palaces of Muslim and 

15
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
Christian rulers of medieval Spain. Often planted with orange and myrtle trees, they were places of 

16
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:30.450
relaxation and romance to enjoy both company and song.
