00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.428
This painting illustrates a passage from the great 17th century Persian epic history, the Shahnama

2
00:00:10.428 --> 00:00:16.774
Rustam rescues Bizhan from the Pit tells the story of the fearful leader Rustam and his imprisoned companion Bizhan.

3
00:00:16.774 --> 00:00:23.131
The image dramatizes the heroic aspects of Rustam through the use of scale, as seen in the oversized figure.

4
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:26.289
Rustam is the son of Zal who was an Iranian king.

5
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.000
He is a celebrated legendary character as he appears in some of the most popular poems of the Shahnama.

6
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This scene is shown a few moments after Rustam lifted the boulder that was blocking the hole.

7
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
As each of Rustam’s warriors who accompanied him into the mountains were unable to

8
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.143
complete the task of removing the boulder they stood aside with looks of despair.

9
00:00:45.143 --> 00:00:49.323
On top of the hill was a fire that shone brightly, highlighting Rustam

10
00:00:49.323 --> 00:00:54.524
Rustam cried out a prayer “oh please God, give me the strength to move this boulder”

11
00:00:54.524 --> 00:00:58.000
and at once lifted the boulder to get to Bizhan.

12
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Rustam then hollered down to Bizhan curious how he got himself into such a horrendous predicament asking

13
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
“how camest thou to such a luckless plight?”

14
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Bizhan, looking up at the magnificent Rustam is joyous to hear that he has come for him.

15
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Rustam urgently demands an apology from Bizhan.

16
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
He asks that he grant forgiveness to his envious companion Gurgin and if not

17
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
then he has no option but to leave him in the hole to die.

18
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Threatening with this ultimatum Bizhan is left with no choice but to make amends with Gurgin

19
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
At this time Rustam throws down his lasso into the pit, which is pictured

20
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and hand over hand without aid pulled out Bizhan.

21
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The condition of Bizhan was dire and mangy from being in the pit.

22
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
His body was restrained by chains which Rustam snapped with his bare hands.

23
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Freed at last the two mounted their horses and headed back to Rustam’s home

24
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
where Bizhan could be cleaned up and would make amends with Gurgin.

25
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Features such as the tilt of the trees in the background and abstract patterns in the sky

26
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
make it feel as if it is stormy outside

27
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
The centrality of Rustam and Bizhan allow the viewer to easily understand

28
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
that they are the focal point of the image as all the other characters are placed off to either side.

29
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Many of these other characters have a hand resting against their chest

30
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
appearing to be concerned of the situation.

31
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
There is a lack of architectural presence as the image chooses

32
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
to focus more on the natural and human relationships.
