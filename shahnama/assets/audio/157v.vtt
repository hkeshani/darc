00:00:04.453 --> 00:00:09.452
Our story begins when an Iranian ruler summons the legendary hero Rustam to his court.

2
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:15.450
Something has been terrorizing both man and beast. The ruler promises Rustam riches and glory

3
00:00:15.685 --> 00:00:21.184
if he can defeat the beast. Rustam says, “I’ll take it on. I fear nothing!

4
00:00:21.226 --> 00:00:29.495
This beast will tremble with fear before my blade!”
After battling for three days, the

5
00:00:29.538 --> 00:00:36.699
beast disappears and Rustam is left to wander the countryside. “Ah! This is no ordinary

6
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.581
beast!” He exclaims, “It has evaded all of my tricks and bested my strongest weapons.

7
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.377
Truly, it must be a fierce demon.”  As the sun goes down, Rustam’s eyes begin

8
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.268
to droop and he falls asleep.
The demon Akvan Div comes over the hill in

9
00:00:54.269 --> 00:01:00.265
a great wind and sees Rustam sleeping. “This is my chance! The great Rustam sleeps

10
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:04.851
like a child.” He picks Rustam up and carries him away.

11
00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:10.495
Akvan Div is only wearing a small waist covering which has a large front slit

12
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.757
that exposes his legs to mid-thigh. He is not wearing a shirt or shoes and

13
00:01:15.816 --> 00:01:22.480
his hair is uncovered, which conveys a feral wildness. Akvan’s lack of Iranian dress standards

14
00:01:22.483 --> 00:01:25.017
highlight that he is an outsider with supernatural status.

15
00:01:25.102 --> 00:01:33.572
Rustam conforms to Iranian dress standards. He wears long sleeves, pant legs, and a turban

16
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:40.951
under his helmet. Rustam however, balances between the Iranian world and supernatural realm. Being the

17
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.536
son of Zal and Rudabeh, Rustam comes from a mythical lineage. He wears an indigenous

18
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.562
Parthian tiger skin which is associated with mythical abilities. There is resemblance between Rustam’s helmet

19
00:01:53.592 --> 00:02:01.384
and Akvan’s nose, ear, eye and mouth shape as well as Rustam’s lasso and Akvan’s

20
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.114
tail. This suggests that they use similar strategies and may even be related.

21
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.641
Animals frame the main scene. The lion and tiger are looking out from jagged mountains.

22
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.696
They could represent the natural world while the mysterious sea creatures serve as symbols for

23
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.572
the mythical world. Akvan Div is positioned above these creatures suggesting that he has authority

24
00:02:25.575 --> 00:02:32.043
in the supernatural world. In lifting Rustam above his head, Akvan Div appears to have

25
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.895
some control over our hero.

26
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.862
Rustam woke,
And his wise head was filled with consternation
He thought: “So this foul

27
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.918
div hath laid for me
A snare like this! Woe for my strength and courage!”

28
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.298
Akvan Div smugly looks around the valley and says, “You get to choose, oh mighty

29
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.090
invincible Rustam. Do you want to be smashed on these jagged mountains to be eaten

30
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.352
by ravenous tigers and lions, or should I throw you into the sea?”

31
00:03:03.734 --> 00:03:11.465
Below Rustam, we see three hungry animals - the tiger, lion, and sea monster - whose eye

32
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.198
gaze is directed towards Rustam. Their jaws are open like they are hungry and waiting

33
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.577
to consume him. Akvan Div holds Rustam on a purple plate-like disk as though

34
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.134
he is presenting him like a meal before these creatures.

35
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.867
Well, thinks Rustam, whatever I choose, he will trick me and do the opposite. If

36
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.454
he throws me into the sea, I can at least swim and fight the sea’s

37
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:41.509
perils and survive. Rustam leans back and says, “Ah, a powerful, enlightened Div like yourself

38
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.654
must know that a drowned soul will never see paradise and will only know eternal

39
00:03:46.655 --> 00:03:53.298
misery. Throw me onto the mountain and let those lions and tigers finally see what

40
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.973
a truly brave man looks like.”

41
00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.558
Now notice Rustam’s posture and position. Even though the text suggests that he is in

42
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.409
 a precarious situation, the image shows a sense of control and command.

43
00:04:06.415 --> 00:04:12.729
He is awake and has a calm, indifferent expression suggesting that despite the circumstances, he

44
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.726
is in control. The natural and mythical creatures are below him including Akvan Div.

45
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:26.017
Akvan’s kneeling stance and slightly bowed head could be submissive and while Rustam’s elevation suggests

46
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:35.218
dominance. “Oh, you fool! Eternal damnation for Iran’s legendary hero is what I truly want.

47
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.863
You will be lost and miserable forever. Trusting a Div will be your downfall!”

48
00:04:40.875 --> 00:04:46.478
The Div throws Rustam into the sea. Rustam battles the sea creatures

49
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.476
and swims to shore. He finds the Div and captures him in one form by

50
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.561
saying God’s name. He slays the Div and offers its head to God.

51
00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:02.734
This encounter requires Rustam, a man from demonic lineage, to engage his physical strength and

52
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:11.113
mythical, trickster qualities. In capturing the Div, Rustam relies and then acknowledges God’s role in

53
00:05:11.115 --> 00:05:18.139
both the natural and mythical world affirming both Iranian and Zoroastrian religious and cultural values.

53
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.695
Rustam then returns to report to the ruler who gives thanks to God and showers

54
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.282
Rustam with treasure.
