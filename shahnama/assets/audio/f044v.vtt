00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.210
The Shahnama is the world’s longest epic poem, written by Ferdowsi around 1012 AD. 

2
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.810
Like all long-running stories, some characters make recurring appearances, and some antagonize the main

3
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:30.520
characters. One antagonist is Afrasiyab of Turan, fierce enemy to Iran. Afrasiyab is pictured

4
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.720
here. He’s the one with the sword. Now let’s take a look at the story

5
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.690
this image is from and see why he has such an axe to grind.

6
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:46.370
Afrasiyab is leading Turan’s 400,000-man army in an invasion of Iran and Shah Naudar’s

7
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.660
140,000. After three battles, Naudar’s battered army retreats. Naudar and some survivors are captured by

8
00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:01.120
Afrasiyab and the other half kill some of Turanians. In retaliation, Afrasiyab decapitates Naudar in

9
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.550
front of his own soldiers and more Iranians who are watching from the hills. Afrasiyab

10
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:13.200
then crowns himself king over Iran, until they can reorganize and overthrow him. Here is

11
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.630
the exact passage from the Shahnama and the lines from the text that the illustration

12
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.560
is derived from, which are called the break-line verse (Mehran, p. 1): “Full of impatience the great Afrasiyab

13
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.600
Looked out for him, and seeing him approach / Reminded him of their ancestral feud…‘Thou

14
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.120
hast deserved whatever ill may come,’ / He said, called fiercely for a scimitar, / Smote Shah

15
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.800
Naudar upon the neck and flung / In foul contempt the body in the dust… / And

16
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.180
left Iran bereft of throne and crown” (Firdowsi ed. Warner, p. 361-2). Our image is from a Safavid illustrated

17
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.050
copy of the Shahnama made in Iran in 1604. The artist centrally depicts the moment

18
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.430
of decapitation, with blood spatter on the scimitar and the ground. Naudar’s crown is knocked

19
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.200
off, and is lower on the page than his head and body. The shah has

20
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.130
fallen, and his army and kingdom with him. Even the Turanians cover their mouths, shocked

21
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.580
at Afrasiyab’s swift brutality, and the Iranian onlookers in the hills cover their mouths as well.

22
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.360
Afrasiyab intends to make a great statement. He brings the prisoners to his command tent

23
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.850
where his soldiers are and performs this execution in front of many witnesses to assert

24
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:38.000
his dominance, stoking fear in the Iranians and his own men. This cruelty prompts Afrasiyab’s

25
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.070
brother, Ighriras, to call for mercy. This feud reminds me of cartel wars in Breaking Bad.

26
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.770
Gus Fring’s partner is killed, and years later, he kills Hector Salamanca in his nursing

27
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.130
home when he has him imprisoned in his room. Now, Gus kills Hector without eyewitnesses,

28
00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.370
but the rivals both reign over large kingdoms that are just a little too close to

29
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.910
each other, and their wars are marked by large assaults and revenge killings of leaders.

30
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:15.400
In the Shahnama, as Mahallati writes, “Ferdowsi refrains from… mapping good and evil within political

31
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.320
boundaries” (p. 910). Although Afrasiyab’s cruelty is shocking, the Turanians themselves are not condemned as evil.

32
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.870
Ighriras, in opposition to Afrasiyab, is a peacemaker. This ancient work shows war for the

33
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.440
tragic occupation that it is, with neither side free of loss nor judged to be

34
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:42.280
right or wrong. To conclude, the Safavids who illustrated the story would find a lot

35
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.550
in common with the Iran of the past. Shock and mourning accompany news of Shah

36
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:54.920
Naudar’s execution, with which the Safavids would have empathized greatly. Safavid society depended highly on

37
00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.030
the shah; in 1600, the shah would command the Safavid chiefs in charge of the

38
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.050
cavalry, and the infantry were paid by and owed their loyalty to the shah (Roy, p. 115),

39
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.040
making the shah in essence the commander-in-chief and the political leader. And losing him

40
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:22.450
would, metaphorically, be cutting the head off the kingdom, which is exactly the situation Iran finds itself in here.
