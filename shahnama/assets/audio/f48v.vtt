00:00:00.00 --> 00:00:09.295
Have you ever been so angry you want to throw something? What about so angry 

2
00:00:09.295 --> 00:00:14.740
you wanted to throw someone? Well this is a story about how this badass got  

3
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.591
got to do that exact thing. Let’s take a look at the scene.

4
00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:25.275
There’s a battle going on. The Iranians are fighting the Turkish army. Here we have some 

5
00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:32.268
particularly brave soldiers hiding behind some rocks and watching. And here we have some actually brave 

6
00:00:32.268 --> 00:00:39.306
soldiers tangled in the midst of battle. It’s chaos here, hooves are flying, weapons are everywhere. 

7
00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:46.344
And this unfortunate soul lost track of the pointy end of his enemy’s spear for a second too long.  

8
00:00:46.344 --> 00:00:53.028
And here we are faced with the gruesome reality of battle—blood and body parts scattered everywhere.

9
00:00:53.028 --> 00:00:55.285
It’s been a bloodbath.  

10
00:00:55.285 --> 00:01:02.058
But look! This is Rustam, our Iranian hero, the man of the hour! And who does he have 

11
00:01:02.058 --> 00:01:09.007
helpless in his strong grasp—none other than the Turkish king himself, the ‘malevolent Afrasiyab’! 

12
00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:15.425
It seems so effortless, one hand grasping his belt, the other on his collar, completely in control. 

13
00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:19.984
Afrasiyab’s men are rushing to help him, but they are way too late. 

14
00:01:19.984 --> 00:01:25.872
If it weren’t because Afrasiyab’s belt ended up snapping in Rustam’s hand, he would be a dead man.

15
00:01:25.872 --> 00:01:30.652
As it was, the lucky div merely took a tumble to the ground, was quickly 

16
00:01:30.652 --> 00:01:34.459
reached by his chieftains, and rescued from Rustam’s ferocity. 

17
00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:41.320
Fun fact: This is Rustam’s first battle and he wanted to distinguish himself among the

18
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.498
heroes and chieftains with whom he was fighting. So who did he choose to go after? 

19
00:01:46.498 --> 00:01:53.094
The big fish. The Man. So while his men were out here being jumped by Turkish soldiers,

20
00:01:53.094 --> 00:01:58.804
he broke through the ranks, grabbed Afrasiyab, and he scared him so badly that Afrasiyab

21
00:01:58.804 --> 00:02:03.230
basically jumped on the nearest fast horse and booked it, leaving his army to be

22
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:09.161
routed by the Iranians. This feat of bravery and strength earned Rustam titles like

23
00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:15.580
“the shelter of the host”, “the Lion”, and “the Mountain”. Afrasiyab himself reported

24
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.980
that “No lion has such strength, his feet touch earth / His head is in the clouds”.  

25
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.849
This shows Rustam’s strength and might. And that even with his own prowess,  

26
00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.933
Afrasiyab was “but a fibre in his grasp”. 

27
00:02:28.933 --> 00:02:34.702
This scene marks an important turning point for Rustam. This is when he starts to 

28
00:02:34.702 --> 00:02:40.367
be recognized as the hero that he is. The incredible strength shown in this scene is just 

29
00:02:40.367 --> 00:02:45.015
one example of many that Rustam will go on to show throughout the rest of the Shahnama, 

30
00:02:45.015 --> 00:02:50.194
distinguishing him from the many strong soldiers and chieftains encountered in this story. 

31
00:02:50.194 --> 00:02:57.010
Yes, Rustam is not the only strong soldier to appear in this episode, but it is his courage,  

32
00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.525
bravery, and prowess on the battlefield that sets him apart from the rest.  

33
00:03:01.525 --> 00:03:07.147
Without a doubt, Rustam is portrayed as the man that not only the Iranian people, but the 

34
00:03:07.147 --> 00:03:11.839
Iranian king himself, can trust to save the day, to keep them safe,  

35
00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:14.318
and to win the battle for them.
