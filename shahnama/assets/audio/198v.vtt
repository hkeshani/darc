00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
A very long time ago, the ancient Persian Sassanid empire and the Roman Empire

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.450
were at odds and the would get into silly little fights and such

3
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.450
In the chapter of Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh, “Anushrivan receives Caesar’s locked chest and other presents”

4
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:24.450
The Roman Emperor, Caesar, sends an envoy to Persia carrying a parcel of gifts in

5
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.045
an attempt to keep the peace. The envoys approach the Shah, and they recite the

6
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.450
letter sent from the Emperor. He is requesting that it would be kind that the

7
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.450
Shah would not invade the Roman Empire, or in other words

8
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.450
“Shah must not ask tribute at our hands, Nor send an army to invade our realm􏰀.”

9
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.450
Also, to incentivize the Shah that another war is not a good idea, here, have some presents.

10
00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.450
The Shah, the king of kings, wearing robes in the important Islamic colours of blue

11
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:06.450
and gold sitting there high and mighty with his fancy Hershey-kiss shaped crown with that cool little

12
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.450
plume just to show how, super-duper important he is, is enamoured by the envoy’s reception.

13
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.450
However, he is also puzzled by it, and summons many advisors to observe and study

14
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.450
the locked boxes. From here on out, I will call them party boxes because of

15
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.450
all the polka dots and cool patterns. In the end, the advisors have difficulty interpreting

16
00:01:30.450 --> 01:36.450
interpreting and opening the boxes. The envoys say that they want someone specifically to open the boxes.

17
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.450
The envoys suggest that they would like the Shah’s wise councillor, the old and almost

18
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.450
blind Buzurghimir, to open these party boxes and to state the contents inside them.

3
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.450
Anushrivan, as the nice guy that he is, pulls him out of prison to do this task

19
00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.450
Now, for whatever reason, the envoys are now comfortable opening the party boxes.

20
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.450
And, they feel that he is more qualified to do it compared to the other councillors.

21
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.450
It doesn’t seem like a very special job to me, but, as we can see right here,

22
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.450
he is obviously thinking really hard about it. He gets credit for that I guess.

23
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.450
In the end, the envoys now feel like opening the party boxes, and Buzurghimir states what's in them.

24
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.450
The contents are not shown in this illustration, but we will use our imagination and

25
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.450
pretend they are actually there. Each party box contains a pearl. The red ones contain

26
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.450
pearls pierced with an iron rod, and the special blue super fun party box in the middle, contains

27
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.450
a pure pearl that is not pierced. The Shah, feeling guilty about neglecting Buzurghimir

28
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.450
(I… guess that’s fair?) is thrilled with the presents. He showers Buzurghimir with treasure for

29
00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.450
his work, and we conclude with the importance of being a good and responsible king

30
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.450
his work, and we conclude with the importance of being a good and responsible king

31
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.450
that being Anushrivan. Buzurghimir, a wise advisor, must bear the obligations with handling the King’s

32
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.450
treasure and to advise the Shah in his ruling, which is a formidable task that requires serious responsibilities

33
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:33.000
The End!
