Narrator: It would be jealousy that would continue this story, a half brother and his successful hero brother would cross paths. However the familial meeting would mark the end of both of these brothers. It would be greed, jealousy and fight for power, dominance and rule.

Shaghad: Brother Rustam, I know of a great plain where game is plenty and hunting is good. Gazelle and Onager move about these beautiful lands and we must take our hunting parties and horses to capture such beasts. The plains are full of water and life and they must be conquered.

00:00.41 —> 00:00.58
Rustam: It would be I Rustam, Son of Zal and my royal steed Rakhsh that will hunt these lands with an army of noble men. I will bring with me my royal bow. I will be protected by Simurgh and guided by the lion.

Narrator: Shaghad had pits dug throughout the plains. These pits were filled to the top with swords and spears all pointed up and disguised in the earth.

Rakhsh: The ground underfoot is fresh like a storm brewed up the soil. Keeping a solid footing while pressing on for the master was a challenge .
Stopping up from a pace of high intensity made Rustam impatient. The earth dropped off from the forefoot and there was no way forward.

Rustam: My royal steed there is not time to stop, there are plenty of game and I must take the lead.

Narrator: Rustam cracked his whip at the Rakhsh, who then sprung forward and fell into the pit. Rakhsh was impaled by the swords and spears. Wounds were left all over Rustam’s body. The spears penetrated through his chest, arms and legs. The mighty Rustam son of Zal was able to pull himself out of the pit.

Rustam: Brother, you have betrayed me, O’ man of Black and Evil Destiny. You have killed me on my own land and must pay. Your deeds will not come unnoticed and evil will follow you. My son will see what you have done and will exact vengeance on my behalf.

00:02.02 —> 00:02.22
Narrator: Rustam, the trickster had one final act before he laid his head. He knew he could exact his own revenge but would be careful how he did so. 

Rustam: Brother, I am defenseless here. I as ruler am unprotected against the lions that wish to prey on me. Please offer me mercy and give me my bow and arrow to protect myself in my dying breaths.

Shaghad: Ha Ha Ha I have killed the beast that is so savage it bear with him the head of another beast upon its own head. You my brother shall perish in the depths of the evil god Ahriman. I will bring you your bow and arrow.
Narrator: Rustam receives the bow and arrow and proceeds to pin his brother to the tree in his last act. He is pleased with his revenge but only just before both men collapse and die there together.
