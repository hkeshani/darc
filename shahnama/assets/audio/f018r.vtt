00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.768
The story of “Tur and Salm murder Iraj” is one filled with family rivalry and hatred,

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
intrigued are we? Let me take you back to where it all began...

3
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:20.900
A man named Faridun had three sons named: Salm, Tur and Iraj. Faridun tells his sons:

4
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.450
“Salm I give you rule over the West and they all will bow down to you as lord.

5
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.200
Tur I give you rule over the Turkman’s and the land of Chin,

6
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:38.000
and there they will all hail you as king. For my youngest precious son, Iraj,

7
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.000
I give you all of Iran and the majesty and crown of chiefs.”

8
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.000
Naturally, when you’re youngest brother gets more of the kingdom than you, you become angry

9
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.200
Salm on the left and brother Tur on the right, become so angry

10
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.450
that come up with a plan, a master plan to deal with their younger brother Iraj.

11
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.000
We can see here that the brothers are full of guile,

12
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.450
which is used as a powerful weapon and driving force of this story

13
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and as you can see in this image, leads to a chair being thrown!

14
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.100
but we’ll get to that part later. So Salm and Tur team up to create an envoy,

15
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.200
both in their hearts ready to go to war against their youngest brother.

16
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.450
Iraj, being an honest young ruler finds out that his brothers are angry with him

17
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.100
and decides he wants to go and see them to fix things! (Little does he know that this is not what they had in mind...)

18
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.500
Iraj then sets out to visit his brothers with a letter in hand from their father Feridun.

19
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.100
The letter stating: “He hath a right to love and tenderness. Hold him in honour, and repent yourselves;

20
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.800
As I have fed his body feed his soul, and after he hath been with you awhile

21
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.750
Send my beloved one back to me.” Which lets be real for a second,

22
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.000
if you have ever gone to your siblings with mom or dads stamp of approval on you,

23
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.000
you know that this never helps fix the problem.

24
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.450
So with his letter in hand Iraj sets out to see his brothers.

25
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.100
Now, where this story starts to get interesting

26
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.900
is when the troops shown all along the outside of this manuscript

26
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.200
framing the middle action of this image start to get chatty. Having overheard his troops

27
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:43.200
Salm became even more vengeful because he found out that they think Iraj is deserving of being King!

28
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.100
So, that next morning Iraj meets with his brothers Salm and Tur in his tent.

29
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.200
The brothers confront Iraj, asking him why he thinks he deserves to be king

30
00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.000
when he was just the youngest? Iraj replies that he “doesn’t want the crown,

31
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.100
he wants there to be no feud between them and that he wants to make peace.”

32
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.000
I’m sure you can guess by this picture that their response isn’t positive to that comment...

33
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:21.100
Filled with anger, writer Laurie Pierce would even say filled with a kind of demon, Salm picks up a chair

34
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:29.000
and strikes Iraj with it. Iraj clearly depicted PLEADING for his life asks his brothers to show mercy on him.

35
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.100
asks his brothers to show mercy on him.“Canst thou approve and reconcile these twain-

36
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:42.000
To be a murderer and live thyself? Oh! hurt not e’en the poor grain-dragging ant,

37
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:52.100
For it hath thy life, and sweet life is a joy!” Salm and Tur ignore Iraj's plea

38
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.750
and Tur taking a dagger out of his boot stabs Iraj in the heart and beheads him.

39
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.250
A key element of this story is the anger and guile the brothers feel towards their brother.

40
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.450
So overwhelmed the rulers act out in rage, ignoring their moral values.

41
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:17.200
Iraj, I believe, represents an ideal of what noble kingship should like,

42
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.750
even though his life ended by him being murdered by his brothers.
