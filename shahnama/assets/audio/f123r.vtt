00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.968
In this section of the Shahnama, Kaykhursau has just ascended to the throne. He has 

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.650
given Tus the role of commander of his army on the condition that he take

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.150
them to Turan and capture Afrasiyab to avenge his father. A questionable decision on Kaykhusrau's part

4
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.160
given that Tus was one of the few characters who protested his rise in power. 

5
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.450
Kaykhusrau specified that Tus was to avoid travelling through Kalat because his stepbrother, the great 

6
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:31.200
warrior Farud, lives there with his mother, Jarireh, but Tus had his own agenda...

7
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.000
Farud had previously fought against Tus' army, killing Tus' son, Zarasp, and son-in-law, Rivniz in

8
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.570
the process. Consumed with anger, Tus led his troops to the fortress, disregarding Kaykhursau's orders.

9
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.520
Tus was given some lemons when Kaykhusrau allowed him to remain as commander despite his

10
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.900
behavior in the past, but instead of making lemonade, he has left them to rot 

11
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.170
by taking his position for granted and disobeying his king. Revenge is a terrible thing.

12
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.280
Upon seeing the army on its way to the fortress, Farud says to his mother 

13
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.150
that he is prepared to die but will give the fight his all no matter

14
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.160
the consequences. He is brave, but a realist. She is concerned and heavy-hearted. 

15
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.250
Tus says to his men before the battle, "I will send up this hold's

16
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.010
dust to the sun. To avenge beloved Zarasp, the cavalier, I will attack without delay.

17
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.660
I will make this Turkman wretch a corpse, and with his gore engrain the stones

18
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:40.150
like coral to the core..." Tus is fighting solely for revenge, Farud is fighting

19
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.150
because he must...

20
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.450
Farud and his forces hold off Tus' army for much of the battle, but unfortunately

21
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.450
Jarireh's worries were warranted after all. Farud takes notice that his army has thinned and 

22
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.000
decides to escape into the fortress to rally his troops and rest. His noble effort

23
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.300
to race back was thwarted by an ambush by two of Tus' most experienced warriors: 

24
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.200
the heroes Ruhham and Bizhan. Two on one is no fair fight, not even 

25
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.450
for a legendary warrior.

26
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.450
Depicted in the illustration is the moment Ruhham pierces Farud's shoulder, disabling his ability to 

27
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.450
wield a sword and mortally wounding him. Bizhan sits on his horse on the left

28
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.250
side, preventing Farud's safe passage along the uneven ground. After crying out in pain, Farud

29
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.450
despterately makes his way around them and into the castle, nearly knocking Bizhan out with 

30
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.450
a smack to the head on the way. The gate quickly shuts behind him. 

31
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:46.600
Now, having escaped the battlefield, Farud lays on his ivory throne, bleeding out, whispering his 

32
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.150
last words: "Let all whose hearts and cheeks burn for my life, go fling

33
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.250
themselves down from the battlements that none may be the portion of Bizhan. I'll follow 

34
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.250
soon because he severeth my blameless life and is, in this day of youth, my 

35
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.150
death. 

36
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.450
To spare herself from further pain, Jarireh proceeded to burn all the treasures and commit 

37
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.150
suicide. 

38
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.200
The servants followed by jumping off the castle walls as instructed by Farud. 

39
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.250
Once Tus, Bizhan and Ruhham entered the fortress, they were appalled at what they saw. 

40
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.150
Farud and his forces had fought bravely, but no one could have expected this contingency 

41
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.250
plan to be enforced once he had retreated. Tus knew he had made a huge  

42
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.000
mistake, and that the consequences when Kaykhursau found out would be dire.
