00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.427
This image tells the story of our two characters from the Shahnameh; Zal and Rudaba.

2
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.107
The two characters are the 1604 version of Rapunzel and her prince. However, unlike Rapunzel
3
00:00:12.107 --> 00:00:17.117
 and her Prince charming, their story does not begin with love; it begins with two

4
00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:22.544
enemies. These two star-crossed lovers had never met in person until this image. Prior

5
00:00:22.544 --> 00:00:27.137
to this scene, they had only heard of one another through word of mouth by
6
00:00:27.137 --> 00:00:31.311
their parents. However, their parents did not wish for the two lovers to ever meet

7
00:00:31.311 --> 00:00:35.695
because they did not want the two lovers to end up together. But Zal and

8
00:00:35.695 --> 00:00:33.862
Rudaba had other plans for their future.

9
00:00:38.862 --> 00:00:45.923
The two lovers first meet up in Rudabas tower after hours. The important thing to

10
00:00:45.923 --> 00:00:50.307
look at in this image in the length of Rudabas hair. In this image, you

11
00:00:50.307 --> 00:00:52.812
can see that her hair stretches from the top of her head all the way

12
00:00:52.812 --> 00:00:57.613
to underneath her bottom. In order for Zal to get into Rudabas tower, she offered

13
00:00:57.613 --> 00:01:02.623
her hair for Zal to climb to the top. However, being the gentleman that Zal

14
00:01:02.623 --> 00:01:07.215
is he would rather use his rope to climb the tower than hurt Rudaba by

15
00:01:07.215 --> 00:01:11.807
climbing up using her hair. So, in this image, the hair is of rather importance

16
00:01:11.807 --> 00:01:17.026
because it shows readers a direct image of Rudabas hair and how it relates her

17
00:01:17.026 --> 00:01:20.575
more to our modern day Rapunzel.

18
00:01:20.575 --> 00:01:25.793
In the Shamanah it reads: “At dusk, they locked the gate and took the key

19
00:01:25.793 --> 00:01:30.803
And then a damsel went to Zal and said:--/’All is prepared so come’”

20
00:01:30.803 --> 00:01:35.395
For these two lovers to meet there was a journey that had to happen for

21
00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:41.658
two young women. Rudabas damsels were sent to find Zal prior to the two meeting.

22
00:01:41.658 --> 00:01:46.459
Rudaba was put into this tower so that she would never meet Zal because their

23
00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:50.425
parents did not like each other. However, Rudaba and Zal were in love and needed

24
00:01:50.425 --> 00:01:57.939
to meet each other. So Rudaba sends her two damsels to find Zal and invite

25
00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.906
him back to the tower so they can have an evening together. In this image,

26
00:02:01.906 --> 00:02:06.289
we can depict the two observers at the top of this image to be Rudabas

27
00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.464
damsels. They are looking over the top and admire the fact that they brought these

28
00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:14.848
two people together; just as children would admire their parents.

29
00:02:14.848 --> 00:02:20.066
The two lovers spend the entire evening together and it may be implied that they

30
00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:25.493
were involved in sexual intercourse for a majority of the evening. Another important observation to

31
00:02:25.493 --> 00:02:30.086
make is the crown a top of Zal’s head. This is important because it shows

32
00:02:30.086 --> 00:02:34.469
the royalty that Zal is and how these two lovers being together would mean a

33
00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:38.227
future of royalty together as a couple. While their parents did not want these two

34
00:02:38.227 --> 00:02:43.445
to end up together they did in fact eventually change their minds. The two characters

35
00:02:43.445 --> 00:02:48.873
ended up happily ever after and even gave birth to the Great Conquerer, Rustam. If

36
00:02:48.873 --> 00:02:43.465
it were not for Rudabas damsels these two lovers would have never met and brought

37
00:02:43.465 --> 00:02:58.475
the future royalty for them and their son. This story was the introduction of Rapunzel

38
00:02:58.475 --> 00:03:02.650
to this era and now we have many other versions derived from this.
