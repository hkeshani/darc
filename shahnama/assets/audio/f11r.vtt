00:00:05.249 --> 00:00:12.180
Written by Firdawsi in the 11th century, the Shahnama is a story told about many kings and heroes from the pre-Islamic era.

2
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:18.346
This illustration depicts a painful moment where a dear friend and a king is lost.

3
00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:24.787
Reflecting this time of mourning, the sky is painted dark and windy as the clouds try to scurry away.

4
00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:29.594
Nobles, ministers and loyal servants gather around the king

5
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.681
as they watch him present his last wishes and take his last breath.

6
00:00:33.981 --> 00:00:39.461
A royal doctor sits and holds the king’s hand as he guides him towards death.

7
00:00:39.461 --> 00:00:43.826
A loyal friend embraces the king reflecting a true bond.

8
00:00:43.826 --> 00:00:48.934
Those guilty of murder and treason against the king sit at the bottom,

9
00:00:48.934 --> 00:00:51.105
signifying their loss of status.

10
00:00:51.105 --> 00:00:56.864
Forming a circle around the king, there is a sense of unity, love and respect

11
00:00:56.864 --> 00:01:01.044
presented on the behalf of everyone as they wait for death to come.

12
00:01:01.044 --> 00:01:06.988
While it was a victorious moment for the kingdom through the defeat of their enemy,

13
00:01:06.988 --> 00:01:10.053
King Dara was left injured with a stab wound in his chest.

14
00:01:10.053 --> 00:01:19.062
King Dara lies in the middle of the image, wearing red, as his close friend Sikander, wearing light blue, holds him.

15
00:01:19.062 --> 00:01:26.586
The powerful bond between the friends is shown, as a tear-filled Sikander holds Dara’s head on his lap.

16
00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:34.202
And with his hands, Sikander removes Dara’s crown and armor from his body and places at his feet.

17
00:01:34.202 --> 00:01:39.960
Scared of losing his friend, Sikander begins to tell Dara to be strong and to

18
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.211
find the strength and courage to sit upon the horse once again.

19 --
00:01:43.211 --> 00:01:50.549
Sikander explained the immense amount of pain he was going through since discovering

20
00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.493
Dara’s injury in battle. Dara said to Sikander “Death is much more nearer to me than the throne.”

21
00:01:56.493 --> 00:02:04.016
Accepting that death was close, Dara praises his allies gained from his kingship and wealth.

22
00:02:04.016 --> 00:02:10.332
Dara acknowledges his arms, troops, noble steed, throne and crown.

23
00:02:10.332 --> 00:02:18.541
As Dara approaches his last breath, Dara tells Sikander his last wishes in front of the loyalists as a witness.

24
00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:23.650
Dara asked for the protection of his children and his beloved wife.

25
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:31.916
Dara wished that his only daughter, Rushanak, to be married  and to share the throne with her husband in happiness.

26
00:02:31.916 --> 00:02:40.182
In wedlock, she would give birth to a son to be named Asfandiyar, who would be the successor to the throne.

27
00:02:40.182 --> 00:02:45.941
Dara wanted this prince to bring back the Glory and Faith of the good days.

28
00:02:45.941 --> 00:02:52.721
Dara believed the next generation of rulers could bring back prosperity and growth

29
00:02:52.721 --> 00:03:00.616
to the kingdom. Sikander gracefully accepted Dara’s wishes and Dara passes.

30
00:03:00.616 --> 00:03:08.882
Dara is buried in a charnel-house draped with jewellery, golden brocade and a golden throne.

31
00:03:08.882 --> 00:03:14.176
During the burial, there was no dry eye mourning the death of their king.

32
00:03:14.176 --> 00:03:18.727
While this image depicts pain for the loss of their king,

33
00:03:18.727 --> 00:03:22.535
there is also a reflection of those guilty of murder.

34
00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:28.758
In turn, this illustration presents the two men wearing blue and yellow at the bottom,

35
00:03:28.758 --> 00:03:34.145
guilty of crimes against King Dara. The men guilty of murder

36
00:03:34.145 --> 00:03:39.811
were loyal ministers of the king. Now they kneel at the feet of the dying king,

37
00:03:39.811 --> 00:03:44.455
stripped of their turbans and armour with their hands cuffed to their backs,

38
00:03:44.455 --> 00:03:47.520
reflecting their loss of status in the kingdom.

39
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.814
Sikander’s emotions of loss fueled his desire for revenge.

40
00:03:52.814 --> 00:03:58.201
He spoke of justice from those that committed the act against their king.

41
00:03:58.201 --> 00:04:04.610
Sikander’s notion of revenge and protection of the kingdom led the nobles to

42
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.861
hail Sikander “as the ruler of the earth.”

43
00:04:07.861 --> 00:04:13.991
And thus, the death of a precious king led Sikander on a new journey.
