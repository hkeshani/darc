00:00:02.875 --> 00:00:08.672
We begin our story by peaking into the private chambers of Prince Siyawush and Princess

2
00:00:08.744 --> 00:00:14.181
Farangis. As you can tell, they are the only ones in their room, but not

3
00:00:14.182 --> 00:00:19.355
the only characters depicted in the image!  Scattered around the outside of the room are

4
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.320
various women, each focused on the central figures of the Prince and Princess.  So, what

5
00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:30.375
exactly are we witnessing here? What is it about these two that has drawn the

6
00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:37.210
attention of everybody, including you and I?  This is their first meeting!  And not just

7
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.358
any meeting.  Have you ever heard of the tv show “Married at first sight?”  This

8
00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:49.036
is the pretty much the 17th century version of that show! On the left we

9
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.833
have Prince Siyawush of Iran.  Notice the simplicity of his dress and the bareness of

10
00:00:54.857 --> 00:01:01.690
his face? He is a young Prince quite out of his usual luxurious element. After

11
00:01:01.756 --> 00:01:06.850
declining his stepmother's’ romantic advances, the Prince was forced to flee his homeland and take

12
00:01:06.882 --> 00:01:13.005
shelter in the rival nation of Turan.  He soon made friends with a well-respected

13
00:01:13.063 --> 00:01:19.195
courts man who suggests an arranged marriage with Farangis, the Princess of Turan.

14
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:28.010
Farangis’ father, King Afrasiyab had some misgivings about this plan.  His astrologers had previously warned

15
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.418
him that such a union between the kingdoms could lead to his ultimate demise!

16
00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:37.137
In the end, however, he was won over by the courts man, and the two

17
00:01:37.245 --> 00:01:44.132
were wed. So here they are, first laying eyes upon their newly minted spouse!

18
00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:50.000
Notice the space between the Prince and Princess. We can clearly make out the carpet between

19
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:55.463
them and the door behind them within the space. The only connecting point is their

20
00:01:55.465 --> 00:02:02.098
limbs – with Siyawush reaching out both arms to hold onto Farangis in a caring gesture.

21
00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:07.967
The Princess’ response is a slight smile and the shy covering of her lower face

22
00:02:07.967 --> 00:02:13.908
with her sleeve. While there is a tentative feel to this exchange, both parties appear

23
00:02:13.932 --> 00:02:17.358
relaxed and interested in this fresh encounter.

24
00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:24.525
Notice the warm shades colouring the scene. Orange, yellow and red are used with prominence,

25
00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:31.323
and the entire scene is outlined with gold.  Cooler items are coupled with warm details:

26
00:02:31.325 --> 00:02:37.090
The purple patterned walls on either side have many vibrant red dots throughout and the

27
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.115
tiled blue roof is marked with small red crosses.  The image feels hospitable and inviting,

28
00:02:44.067 --> 00:02:49.840
with the colour palate evoking feelings of warmth, much like being drawn into a room

29
00:02:49.816 --> 00:02:56.212
by a cozy hearth fire. This tone foreshadows the deep love that will quickly grow

30
00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.290
between the Prince and Princess. Their love is described as the union of “Venus and

31
00:03:02.297 --> 00:03:07.825
the Sun.” The couple go on to enjoy the benefits extended to Siyawush by King

32
00:03:07.831 --> 00:03:16.100
Afrasayib. He makes Siyawush the ruler of the lands east of Turan. Here, Siyawush has

33
00:03:16.102 --> 00:03:21.964
a grandiose palace built and the couple enjoys their life together. Their love is not

34
00:03:21.965 --> 00:03:27.857
to last though, as the jealousy and lies of Farangis’ Uncle tear the couple apart

35
00:03:27.858 --> 00:03:36.349
and the prophecy of King Afrasiyab’s demise comes to pass. But that chapter is for

36
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:43.020
another time. For now, let us enjoy this moment of young love budding between Prince

37
00:03:42.996 --> 00:03:50.925
Siyawush and Princess Farangis in their magical first encounter.
