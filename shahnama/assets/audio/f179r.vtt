00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
During the period of Greater Iran, there was a national hero named Bizhan, one of

2
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:17.000
the greatest Iranian heroes in the history who is also the son of Giv and grandson

3
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:25.140
of Rustam, a world-famous warrior. One day, Bizhan won another victory when he came

4
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:33.106
to battle with Human. Human was strong, proceed without hesitation. But Bizhan was even
stronger!

5
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:42.700
Soon after, they all wounded, nevertheless they tried to persist, stood straight,
fought back hard.

6
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.292
Sadly, they fell on the ground one after another. As Bizhan
approached Human, “His left

7
00:00:51.287 --> 00:00:57.709
hand gripped his foeman’s neck, the right His foeman’s
thigh, he bent that mighty Camel,

8
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.000
raised him aloft, and flung him to the ground”

9
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
He ended Human’s life with a dagger, the two trees at the far back seems

10
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.624
to be blowing by wind, indicating the whole scene happened so fast and in intense

11
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.110
atmosphere. The direction of tree blowing is parallel to that of Bizhan’s head movement, depicts

12
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
the intensity of this combat.

13
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Human’s misery was over. Bizhan had pale face with very determinant facial
expression, in contrast

14
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.560
to Human (the person on the ground) had red face with painful
facial expression, trying

15
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.540
to stop Bizhan from attacking him by dagger. Human was
wounded terribly and bleeding.

16
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.800
The guy in the lower left corner with orange shirt,
wearing a hat seemed to

17
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
be shocked by their fight, put his finger in his mouth,meanwhile starring at the

18
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:11.510
fighting scene. He also has pale face, same as Bizhan,indicating that they might belong

19
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.057
to the same group.

20
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.200
While the guy on the upper right corner, with red-ish face, similar to that

21
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.500
of Human’s showing that they may belong to the same group, he also showed a

22
00:02:24.726 --> 00:02:32.000
worry face, maybe worrying about Human’s fate. He took revenge on his enemy Human for

23
00:02:32.595 --> 00:02:40.300
Siyawush and his seventy brothers by cutting off Human’s head. Then, his horse was being

24
00:02:40.555 --> 00:02:46.700
brought to him, he bounded Human’s head to the saddle-straps, let the trunk decompose

25
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.882
in sand.

26
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.213
He’s going to show-off his war trophy. As Bizhan put on Human’s armour,

27
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
two interpreters ran to Bizhan to worship him as Brahmans. They were stunned not only

28
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.962
by the scene that just happened before their eyes, but also by Bizhan’s fearless.

29
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.500
Bizhan scanned around the battlefield, couldn’t help to save the Turkman host. Human’s
interpreter was

30
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.797
trembling, fearful of Bizhan, the standard of the Iranian chief was down.

31
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.304
The interpreter returned to his country and told Piran, king of Turan, “The glory of

32
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.631
the empire is bedimmed.” The Turanian army cried after heard the death of Human.

33
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:47.000
Meanwhile a cameleer told Gudarz (Bizhan’s grandfather) of the Iranian host that
Bizhan was back

34
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
in triumph, carried the sable flag in reversed. Bizhan’s father was
eager to see his

35
00:03:54.727 --> 00:04:04.134
son after learned the news of his heroic son, he embraced and
congratulated the hero

36
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:16.000
for his braveness. His grandfather Gudarz bestowed him with crown, royal robe and jewelries.
