00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
This folio illustration from 1604 accompanies the tale of the young prince Kay Khusrau from

2
00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:12.850
the persian epic, the Shahnama. When we combine this folio with its accompanying tale,

3
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.300
we come to gain an in depth knowledge of the story. This image is made

4
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.180
to come alive through the artist's use of character depiction, and their clever positioning within

5
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.610
the space. It is aspects such as these that aid in giving this folio its

6
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.390
multifaceted and dynamic feel. Here we will be focusing on the three characters located at

7
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.230
the forefront of this image, as they attempt to escape those located to the rear

8
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.090
of the image. The three main characters can be located on horseback and are

9
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.940
in the midst of traveling to Iran. It was prophesied that a warrior by the name

10
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.590
 of Giv, would locate the the young prince Khusrow, and escort him back to Iran

11
00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.910
a to the vacant throne. We are witnessing a crucial river crossing, one that will take

12
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.210
the group out of the reach of those pursuing them. The throne of Iran has

13
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.360
recently been vacated, and although Khusrow has been prophesied as the next Shah, there are

14
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.170
others, who believe their claims validity. Those we see in the images background have

15
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.060
 been sent by one such challenger, with the mission of stopping this caravan of

16
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:30.960
three before they cross this river. We can locate Giv thanks to his description in

17
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.950
the narrative. Described as a “noble warrior,” and a “Veteran of toil,” we know he is

18
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:44.430
a man of combat. He is dressed in in clothing that indicates his status,

19
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.440
forearm bracers, arrows, and other armour. He has spent many dangerous years searching throughout

20
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.680
the islamic world for the young prince, and is keen to see this journey through

21
00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.090
 to its completion. As we pan across we come to the prince’s mother, Farangis, who

22
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.850
can be identified thanks to this passage from the text, “Whilst Farangis assumed the helmet.”

23
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.380
The central of our three figures is not only female, but also appears to be

24
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.590
wearing the aforementioned helmet. She has joined her son and Giv on their journey

25
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.850
to Iran, after having bestowed upon them armour and jewels previously hidden in her palace.

26
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:31.590
 The two are both focusing on those whom advance upon them, showing their concern, as

27
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.850
well as perhaps inferring their roles as “protectors” of Khusrow.” Finally we come Kay Khosrow

28
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.080
himself, the young prince who has been prophesied to become the leader of Iran, and

29
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.230
by extension, the Persian empire. Our main character can be identified thanks to both his

30
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:56.140
dress and his horse. He is outfitted in the rich and kingly clothing, and sat

31
00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.710
astride his famous horse. A black steed so fast it is able to “blast out

32
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:08.440
of sight.”  The prince and those accompanying him run into some issues when the man

33
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.820
charged with ferrying travelers across the river refuses to comply. It is for this reason

34
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.370
that they decide to take fate into their own hands, and cross the river on

35
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.950
horseback. Here we can see that Khusrow is more concerned with getting across the

36
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.250
river and into what will become his kingdom, providing charity to a peasant and

37
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.950
facing in the direction of their travel. This is in direct contrast to his

38
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.540
mother and Giv, who as we previously noted are more concerned with those in

39
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.140
the distance. Khusrow, Giv, and Farangis do make it to Iran and the young prince

40
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:51.340
goes on to fulfil the prophecy, claiming the becoming one of Iran’s greatest rulers.”
