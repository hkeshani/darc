00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.365
Within the pages of the book of kings known as the Shahnama there were stories

2
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:10.403
of Heroes and in that book there was no superior hero of Persian tales than

3
00:00:10.404 --> 00:00:16.254
Rostam. Rostam was the son of Zal and was also, a liminal figure, a man


4
00:00:16.255 --> 00:00:23.497
who interacts with the supernatural animal kingdom as well Rostam ruled over his own border. He


5
00:00:23.498 --> 00:00:29.664
was most commonly known to been a world-famous warrior, and just hearing his name alone


6
00:00:29.665 --> 00:00:36.905
tremble his enemy. In this story, he had finally reached the Khan of Chin, also

7
00:00:36.906 --> 00:00:40.621
known as the king of china. Many warriors were sent by the Chinese king to

8
00:00:40.622 --> 00:00:45.636
find out who Rustam was, and to track down how he was taking out all

9
00:00:45.637 --> 00:00:50.373
the king’s men and lions. However, Rostam was able to get the upper hand and

10
00:00:50.374 --> 00:00:55.667
 vanquish all the warriors that the king sent. Leaving the King of China left in

11
00:00:55.668 --> 00:01:00.683
Rustam’s path. The story unfolds on a day with autumn winds so powerful, they could

12
00:01:00.684 --> 00:01:07.834
have blasted trees. With skies filled with fight, as archers took majority of the sky

13
00:01:07.835 --> 00:01:12.664
and filled it with arrows. As if the arrows were the stars covering the sky.

14
00:01:12.665 --> 00:01:18.051
The King of China however was not worried about the might of Rostam, as he

15
00:01:18.052 --> 00:01:23.903
believed he had enough men to outnumber Rostam’s men three hundred to one. To prove

16
00:01:23.904 --> 00:01:28.825
that Rustam was the warrior that even the King of China should fear, Rostam charged

17
00:01:28.826 --> 00:01:33.098
towards one of the King’s men, to show that he was not there for peace.

18
00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:38.299
He then loosened his lasso and flung his coil, wrapping it around the man like

19
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.757
 a noose. He left this mighty man as no more than a few pieces on

20
00:01:42.758 --> 00:01:48.051
the ground. The King had never seen this amount of powerful force, it made him

21
00:01:48.052 --> 00:01:53.346
feel like the earth rose like the Nile. The King realized he was outmatched and

22
00:01:53.347 --> 00:02:00.219
called for peace, hoping Rustam’s heart was not full of revenge. However, The King surrendering was

23
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.906
not substantial enough for Rustam. As a victorious warrior, Rostam was a greedy man with

24
00:02:06.987 --> 00:02:12.293
high a self-esteem. Therefore, he craved the crown and with it, he wanted all the

25
00:02:12.294 --> 00:02:17.866
elephants and the ivory throne that came with the King’s authority. So Rustam being almighty

26
00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:23.531
about himself, announced he did not plan on killing the king but still would face

27
00:02:23.532 --> 00:02:29.847
the wrath of Rustam’s lasso. So Rostam hopped up on his horse named Rakhsh and

28
00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:35.792
charged the king of China. Rustam flew his lasso over the Chinese King, and noosed

29
00:02:35.793 --> 00:02:41.179
it around his neck. Like a cowboy would rounding up a cow. Than Rostam yanked

30
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.198
 the Chinese King off his triumphant elephant and dashed him onto the ground. Where Rustam’s

31
00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:52.956
men bound the King’s hands, and dragged him off toward the Shahd. Leaving the Chinese

32
00:02:52.957 --> 00:02:59.529
King’s crown behind him, finally giving Rustam the chance to claim it.
