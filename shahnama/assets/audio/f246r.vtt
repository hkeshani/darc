00:00:05.555 --> 00:00:13.089
The Shahnama contains many stories telling of great heroes and warriors. In regard to this image,

2
00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:18.401
we will be looking into one of the many adventures of a hero called Isfandiyar.

3
00:00:20.276 --> 00:00:27.185
This is the royal Isfandiyar. He has been chosen to complete seven stages, each containing 

4
00:00:27.186 --> 00:00:36.698
great challenges within. These challenges include defeating ghastly enemies from wolves to witches, and in

5
00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:42.358
this third stage, a fire breathing dragon. But we will get back to that.  

6
00:00:44.198 --> 00:00:50.065
Now, You may be wondering who these men in the background are.  Isfandiyar always has

7
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:56.731
an army of people alongside him, who come from many different trades. But the most important

8
00:00:56.732 --> 00:01:03.328
of these men is a man called Gurgsar. Gurgsar is an enemy commander, who has 

9
00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.196
been captured by Isfandiyar and his people. He acts as a spiritual  guide throughout these 

10
00:01:09.197 --> 00:01:14.334
seven challenges and prepares Isfandiyar for what is to come in the future.


11
00:01:16.244 --> 00:01:22.354
This story of the third stage begins with Isfandiyar pouring Gurgsar three goblets of the  

12
00:01:22.355 --> 00:01:28.639
finest of wines. The hero then asks his guide if he will see into the future,

13
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.388
and alert him of the challenge that which he must face the following day,

14
00:01:34.888 --> 00:01:38.915
Gurgsar replies that no people are coming to harm him the following day,

15
00:01:40.165 --> 00:01:46.276
 but then promptly warns him that he will instead come across a great fire breathing dragon. 

16
00:01:47.873 --> 00:01:53.775
 Isfandiyar reacts not with fear, but great confidence, sure that this dragon will not 

17
00:01:53.776 --> 00:01:55.720
escape his wrath alive.

18
00:01:57.004 --> 00:02:03.219
In preparation for this battle, Isfandiyar calls upon some crafty carpenters within his army to

19
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.503
build him a wooden horse drawn carriage. This is no ordinary carriage, but one that is

20
00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:16.065
booby trapped with spikes and swords to maim the dragon. He restlessly waits until the next

21
00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:23.148
day when he is finally approached by the beast who emerges from its dark, ominous cave.

22
00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:30.543
The dragon breathes fire and ferociously roars at Isfandiyar, who in return looks to god

23
00:02:30.544 --> 00:02:33.251
in the sky and asks him for his help.

24
00:02:34.293 --> 00:02:38.112
This is the point in the story in which the image you see is depicted.

25
00:02:39.327 --> 00:02:44.396
We can see that Isfandiyar looks fearful, but is ready for battle with his shield up

26
00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:51.410
and sword in hand. Not only is Isfandiyar fearful, but his army who appear to

27
00:02:51.411 --> 00:02:57.138
be hiding in the background behind the rocks. Will Isfandiyar be a match for this

28
00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:59.534
monster that is looming over him?

29
00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:06.929
The dragon attacks and kills the horses. But in the process, the booby-trapped carriage

30
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.206
works its magic and the dragon ends up swallowing all of the spikes and swords.

31
00:03:12.658 --> 00:03:17.380
They are stuck in its throat, and it begins to choke and bleed profusely.

32
00:03:18.248 --> 00:03:23.664
Isfandiyar then takes this opportunity to make his move and hacks the dragons brain! 

33
00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:28.976
The dragon lets out a cry, and swoons away in painful defeat.

34
00:03:29.948 --> 00:03:37.170
Isfandiyar, uninjured, but overcome by the venomous fumes of the dragon, is lying on the ground.

35
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.315
His army comes out from hiding behind the rock and all rush to his side.

36
00:03:44.148 --> 00:03:50.849
Thinking he is mortally wounded, they begin to pour healing rose water all over his limp body. 

37
00:03:52.446 --> 00:03:59.668
But alas, Isfandiyar rises and says, ‘who could have slain that dragon if the world 

38
00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.820
lord had not assisted him?”

39
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.986
Once again Isfandiyar is victorious, and will now move along to face the next beast who may challenge  him.
