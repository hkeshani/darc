00:00:05.603 --> 00:00:10.591
As an epic work, the Shahnameh does not promote a pacifist view of life. The 

2
00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:16.600
Shahnameh cites war as a reality in human history. Ferdowsi’s theory of just war has 

3
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.000
its foundation in the preservation and expansion of universal justice. According to the Shahnameh, there 

4
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.280
are two reasons to go to war: defending land and dignity and penal or corrective

5
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.394
justice.

6
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.150
This is Alkus. He is a cocky Turanian hero who keeps on rambling about how 

7
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.971
strong he is and how he can defeat Rustam, the greatest hero in the Shahnameh

8
00:00:39.971 --> 00:00:46.560
world. During the fight between the Iranians and Turanians his opportunity arises but he fails 


10
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.556
miserably and is killed almost immediately. 

11
00:00:50.836 --> 00:00:57.525
This is Rustam, the defender and savior of Iran and Iran’s greatest champion. He is  

12
00:00:57.525 --> 00:01:01.098
the son of Zal and Rudabah, who is a descendant of Zahhak, the serpent king.
 
13
00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:08.279
This makes him a half foreigner with a partially demonic ancestry. Unlike the other conventionally 

14
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.959
chivalrous hero’s written about in the Shahnameh, Rustam inhabits a primitive ethos. Unlike other heroes

15
00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:21.778
he can be overbearing towards inferiors, he can be grossly disrespectful to his superiors and  

16
00:01:21.778 --> 00:01:25.735
he does not hide his contempt for those he despises, and he gets drunk and

17
00:01:25.735 --> 00:01:28.273
has been described as a trickster hero by many others.

18
00:01:29.936 --> 00:01:35.109
On his head, Rustam wears a rather unconventional helmet. This helmet is the hollowed out

19
00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:38.736
severed head of the White Div he defeated at the end of his seven trials. 

20
00:01:43.653 --> 00:01:49.314
Now let us get back to the image. As already said, Rustam loves to drink. 

22
00:01:49.931 --> 00:01:53.715
After a day of drinking and feasting, Rustam and seven of his warriors decide that 

23
00:01:53.715 --> 00:01:58.359
going hunting is the best idea in the world. Rather than hunting on Iranian 

24
00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:01.889
land, he decides to ignore all the rules as he always does and decides to 

25
00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:06.572
hunt on the lands of the enemy, King Afrasiyab. Their hunting trip does not 

26
00:02:06.572 --> 00:02:10.964
go unnoticed and they are confronted by a large army. Rustam is on the roll

27
00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:15.835
, going across the battle field killing all the foot soldiers, but when the legendary Turanian 

28
00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:23.000
heroes Pilsam and Alkus appear, things get serious. Alkus takes on Rustam’s brother, Zawara, and 

29
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.625
just as he is about to be killed, Rustam swoops in and a fight between

30
00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:31.645
Alkus and Rustam ensues. Alkus,  "thrusting with a spear at Rustam’s girdle, He failed 

31
00:02:31.645 --> 00:02:35.802
to pierce the mail, while Rustam thrust A spear at his foe’s head and dashed him 

32
00:02:35.802 --> 00:02:38.023
down as t’were a mountain-crag to earth”

33
00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:46.800
Armor is important to every warrior, but unlike other heroes of the Shahnamah, Rustam does 

34
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.170
not wear a metal armor like the one Alkus wears, but the famous babr-e bayan, 

35
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.060
his tiger skin. This has been described as the skin of a fabulous animal, a 

36
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.600
kind of dragon, probably of Indian origin, which was thought to give invincibility on anyone 

37
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.910
who wore it. Many tricksters are associated with specific animals whose skins or feathers they

38
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.950
may wear in order to draw on the animal's characteristics for their own purposes. The 

39
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.400
animals used are usually known for their slyness.

40
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.160
A pair of bāzuband was used in Iran for protecting the forearms during combat. 

41
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.997
A bāzuband has a main steel plate covering the whole forearm, normally with one or

42
00:03:28.997 --> 00:03:34.929
two smaller plates to encircle and close around the wrist, and a textile gauntlet reinforced 

43
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:35.008
with mail for protecting the hands.

44
00:03:37.586 --> 00:03:39.168
The armour protecting the shin was called sāqedin.

45
00:03:43.278 --> 00:03:47.980
The Iranian helmets from the period following the Mongol Invasion in the 13th century had 

46
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.322
a round dome ending at the top with either a pointed tuft or a protruding spike

47
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.640
These helmets had mail or leather aventails to protect the neck and face.

48
00:04:01.642 --> 00:04:07.315
According to Ferdowsi, without war there will be few measures with which to test heroism

49
00:04:07.315 --> 00:04:10.457
and we would not get to know the greatness of these past hereos.
