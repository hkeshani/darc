00:00:06.671 --> 00:00:13.126
This is the tale of Rustam and Sohrab. It is fraught with tears, and sorrow.

2
00:00:13.064 --> 00:00:20.723
It began long ago when the great warrior-hero Rustam had his horse Raksh stolen.

3
00:00:20.847 --> 00:00:26.253
Looking for his horse he came to a palace where he met princess Tahmina. 

4
00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:33.472
Tahmina went into Rustam’s chamber and told him that she has not been able to find a man suitable enough to father her child, 

5
00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:42.207
and that she wanted Rustam to father her child and she would find his horse in return. 

6
00:00:42.728 --> 00:00:47.500
Rustam agreed, they were married and he left the next day 

7
00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:53.796
giving a jewel to Tahmina to give to their child if one is to be born.

8
00:00:53.429 --> 00:01:00.981
Nine months passed and a moon like babe was born. Tahmina had a son whom she named Sohrab,

9
00:01:01.214 --> 00:01:06.294
and he grew up to be a great warrior just like his father Rustam. 

10
00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:14.045
One day Sohrab gathered an army and set out to find his father and make him king of Iran. 

11
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:19.959
Sohrab did not know what his father looked like, he only knew his name.

12
00:01:20.391 --> 00:01:25.255
When he met Rustam, Rustam denied that he was the mighty Rustam

13
00:01:25.286 --> 00:01:29.965
and they battled for a long time, until their weapons were broken and bent. 

14
00:01:30.543 --> 00:01:37.748
They parted and when Rustam returned to his camp he found Sohrab there and he had slain many men. 

15
00:01:38.125 --> 00:01:45.840
Rustam was angry at what he saw and asked Sohrab why he did this when nothing was done to provoke him. 

16
00:01:45.917 --> 00:01:51.229
They argued for a while and when they parted and Sohrab went back to his camp.

17
00:01:51.491 --> 00:01:57.946
The next day when Sohrab met Rustam he offered to make peace with Rustam saying:
 
18
00:01:58.506 --> 00:02:05.803
“Dismount and, sitting, clear our faces with wine, and, leaguing in God’s sight, repent Our former strife.” 

19
00:02:06.336 --> 00:02:15.519
Suhrab once more asked him if he was Rustam but Rustam rejected his proposal and once again denied being Rustam.

20
00:02:16.137 --> 00:02:27.447
They fought and wrestled for a long time. Sohrab had Rustam pinned and ready to kill him but Rustam tricked him into letting him go saying:

21
00:02:28.054 --> 00:02:34.775
“In wrestling none may take a foeman’s head The first time that his back is on the ground, 

22
00:02:34.914 --> 00:02:42.824
but having thrown him twice and won the name of Lion then he may behead the foe: Such is our custom.” 

23
00:02:43.407 --> 00:02:48.303
Sohrab believed him, turned and left.

24
00:02:49.106 --> 00:02:58.116
The next day they met and battled once again. This time Rustam managed to throw Sohrab down and stab him. 

25
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.011
As Sohrab lay there bleeding he said “My mother told me how I should recognize my father.

25
00:03:05.608 --> 00:03:13.687
I sought him in love and die of my desire. Alas! my toils are vain, I have not seen him.“
 
26
00:03:13.964 --> 00:03:18.600
He said his father Rustam will come and avenge his death. 

27
00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:28.761
Hearing this Rustam became distraught and asked Sohrab for proof of this and Sohrab showed him the arm band. 

28
00:03:29.317 --> 00:03:34.073
Then Rustam realized what he had just done and began to weep. 

29
00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:39.091
“Oh! My brave son, approved by all and slain by me.“ 

30
00:03:39.138 --> 00:03:45.778
Rustam threw dust upon himself, wept and pulled onto his own hair until he bled.

31
00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:52.910
Sohrab told him that there was no use in killing himself, that would not change anything. 

32
00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.370
When the other soldiers found out what had happened they all began to mourn with Rustam.

33
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:07.798
Rustam tried to get the medicine to cure Sohrab from Kaus but Kaus refused to give it to him,

34
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:14.334
as he was scared that father and son would overthrow him, and Sohrab died.

35
00:04:15.573 --> 00:04:23.696
After the death of his son Rustam was filled with anguish and sorrow that he burned all of his possessions. 

36
00:04:23.966 --> 00:04:26.359
