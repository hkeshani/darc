5
00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.794
commander in chief to destroy King Sava’s army. Bahram Chubina is an arrogant and fierce

10
00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:05.150
"For my troops and elephants I trample, A mountain if it cometh in my path”.

“But ill luck brought thee hither, being fain. That ill befall thy head”.

13
00:01:18.393 --> 00:01:26.680

“ I will cut of his head and carry it before the Shah,

15
00:01:30.354 --> 00:01:34.797
it is not worth my while to stick it on my spear upon the road.”
