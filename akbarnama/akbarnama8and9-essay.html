    <summary>Introduction</summary>
  <div>
      <p>The Akbarnama is a three book biography about the reign of Mughal emperor Akbar, who took over the throne in 1556. One of the important people in Akbar’s life was his foster brother Adham Khan as well as his foster mother Maham Anaga. During book two of the Akbarnama, Adham Khan was married by Akbar. Weddings during the Mughal empire were celebrated lavishly. There was a lot of importance put into the ceremonies which is evident by the work that went into the folios.  </p>

  <summary>Maham Anaga Influences</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Adham Khan was a general during Akbar’s earlier years. He is also referred to as a foster brother to Akbar due to Maham Agna, Adham’s mother. Akbar’s father Humayun had strict policies causing Akbar to be separated from his mother at a young age. Due to this he had to be fed by many wet-nurses known as Anaga. Maham Anaga played the most important role as she had saved him when Akbar’s uncle tried to kill him, risking her own life while doing so. She became completely dedicated to his well being. Akbar was captured again later on in his life during Humayun’s invasions where he was put in the line of Humayun’s fire. Maham Anaga risked her life once more by shielding him with her body. She played a key role in his survival throughout his childhood. Her loyalty allowed her to ascend in power using it to her own interests. As Akbar conquered Malwa her son Adham Khan was made to be commander of the army.

  <summary>The Rise and Fall of Adham Khan</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Adham Khan was known for two things, his invasion on Malwa as well as his outrageous behaviour. His bravery on the battlefield lead to a successful seizure. However his behaviour was bad from the beginning, taking treasures for himself, sending little home while governing the area until Akbar replaced him. Still Adham Khan was brought back and Akbar honoured him hoping to help Adham overcome his greedy behaviour and folly. Adham Khan however would let his greed lead to his demise. On March 25th 1562 he broke into castle with two accomplices in order to murder Ataga Khan who was another close aide of Akbar that Adham was jealous of. However now hotheaded and panicking from the kill Adham began a one man attack on the palace. A confrontation ensued on the balcony, where Akbar punched Adham in the head to subdue him. Adham was thrown off the terrace by Akbar’s servants. However the first fall failed to kill him so Adham was brought back up to the terrance and thrown off once more this time hitting his head and dying. Adham Khan’s mother Maham Anaga was told by Akbar himself. It was devastating however Maham admitted to the justice saying “Your Majesty did well,”. Maham Anaga would pass away only forty days later.  Adham lost many people in a short period of time, however the  quick and personal execution showed his assertive dominance.

  <summary>The Wedding</summary>
  <div>
  <p>	The first folio consists of the main group, with Akbar sitting in a throne at the upper left. His ankles are crossed and he wears  many necklaces of jewels on his chest and turban. Sitting to his side is Maham Anaga, her close proximity showing her importance to Akbar. Right behind her stands Adham Khan and his bride gazing towards each other. Adham Khan is holding a royal mace which is wrapped in fine textiles and silks. Due to his high rank as general he would cary ornamental objects in order to show status. Spanning the bottom of both folios are princes and nobles bearing gifts wrapped in fabrics to conceal the contents which they would bring on the day of the wedding.   
</p>

<p> In the second folio the grandeur in which Mughal weddings were celebrated is evident. There are women dancing to the music of the band, which can be seen in the upper right playing an array of drums, wind instruments, and a set of symbols. In the upper left men sit while they feast. The feast was a very important part of the Mughal wedding tradition. The Akbarnama reads “In a short time preparations for a feast were made and the marriage took place. The lofty disposition of the Shahenshah made this feast the occasion of a thousand favours.” The Shanhenshah refers to Akbar, as it was the term used for the Persian emperor which meant “king of kings.” A Qazi would perform the rest of the marriage while the emperor stood near. At the very end of the wedding ceremony the newly weds would be showed in gold and gems.

  <summary>Comparative</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Another example of Mughal wedding folios is a scene from the Padshanama in which Shah Jahan, the great grandson of Akbar, honouring his own son Dara Shikoh. This covers a couple folios as well. In this scene another Mughal wedding tradition is happening between the father and son under a canopy at the top. During royal weddings the emperor would wrap a sehra around the groom’s head. The sehra is a veil worn by a man to be married which is made out of pearls and gems. The pearls and gems come down in strands over Dara Shikoh’s face. This was done in the Diwan-i-aam or Hall of Public Audience.
	There are many similar elements between the two weddings, such as women dancing and the gifts being brought to the palace. Wedding scenes seem to take up at least two pages if not more. In the Akbarnama Adham Khan’s wedding is only mentioned in a short paragraph. However the detailed two part folio shows the grander and important of Mughal weddings.

  <summary>Conclusion</summary>
  <div>
  <p>The wedding was a joyous occasion before the future events of further deviance and eventually execution. The Mughal wedding traditions were of great importance, evident by the colours, details and amount of folios in order to show short passages. This scene in particular is very important in showing people who were very close to Akbar. Through all the misbehaviour Akbar prevailed and gave much to Adham Khan and Maham Anaga only for everything to fall apart.
