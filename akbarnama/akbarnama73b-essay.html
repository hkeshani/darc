    <summary>Introduction</summary>
  <div>
      <p>The painting “ Akbar directing attack on Ranthambor Fort” by Khem Karan was made between 1590-1595, and is found in the chronicle the Akbarnama. This painting is an illustration of the historical siege by Emperor Akbar on the Rajput fortress of Ranthambor in 1569.</p>
  <p>Emperor Akbar is seen on top of the cliff on the right side of the painting, he is dressed in white and appears to be in conversation with one of his officials. The detailed design of the gun powder smoke in this painting brings evidence to the unprecedented level of skill of Khem Karan, and his fellow colleagues in Akbar’s art studios. As Akbar invested tremendously into his personal chronicle the Akbarnama, and was supervised by his court historian and biographer Abu’l Fazl. This painting by Khem Karan, is just an example of the unparalleled skill that Akbar’s own 49 artists had during his regime. Further more, the painting brings attention to the middle of the siege, where soldiers and village citizens collide in chaos. This scene illustrates the difficulty in battles from the late Medieval age, as lack of navigation technology creates problems in an effective attack against such an advanced Rajput fortress. This painting also describes the systematic approach by emperor Akbar in this siege, which is further described in the Akbarnama. As this siege in 1569, was not the only attempted attack on this Rajput fortress by Akbar.</p>

  <div>
  <p>Emperor Akbar and the conquering of the Rajput fortress, has been a definite goal for emperor Akbar to complete. Based on historical evidence from the Akbarnama by Abu’l Fazl, the last attempted siege by Akbar was in 1558, but had decided to attack other fortresses (Susan Stronge, 2002).<p>
</p>Akbar was also motivated to capture all the Rajput fortresses, as the Hada Rajput people were considered sworn enemies of the Mughal empire (Stronge, 2002). So Akbar and emperor Raj Surjan Hada of the Rajput fortress, were both informed and prepared for this siege years before the actual attempt in 1569. The one most prepared was emperor Raj Surjan Hada, as historical articles considered the fort to be impregnable by any sort of siege (Andrew Topsfield, 1984). With the Rajput fort being on a hill, Raj Surjan Hada had constructed higher walls which also featured built-in cannons, this proved to be unconquerable on foot by any soldier. So emperor Akbar devised several strategies for his siege in 1569, and was proven to be successful in his siege of the Rajput fortress. First, emperor Akbar had recruited over 5,000 soldiers to circle the Rajput fort, then this number of troops increased up to a peak of 70,000 within weeks of the siege (Stronge, 2002). As illustrated in paintings and described by Abu’l Fazl in the Akbarnama, Akbar used his red fort as the designated area for his cannons to be placed and faced towards the Rajput fort. He then also told his soldiers to take place in the rocky cliffs and place cannon batteries there, which then allowed the Akbar forces to bombard the Rajput fort with several cannon blasts. Descriptions of the cannons say some were 15 feet long, which would be the largest cannons ever produced in the Mughal empire (Stronge, 2002). During this siege, Akbar would see his regimes greatest innovation to cannon technology, as his inventor Fathullah Shirazi developed the volley gun (Topsfield, 1984). This volley gun was a cannon with several barrels of cannonballs that could fire at the sametime, more than 5 cannonballs were capable of being fired simultaneously (Topsfield, 1984). This innovation helped topple the Rajput fortress and prompted Raj Surjan Hada to invite Akbar to his fortress, and formally surrender to the Mughal empire. With this victory, Akbar had expanded his empire and continued the legacy of his prestigious bloodline.<p>

  <summary>The Legacy of Akbar</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Emperor Akbar was not the one and only emperor of the vast and powerful Mughal empire, this empire featured many emperors and they produced several versions of their own individual chronicle. But with emperor Akbar, we saw the Mughal empire flourish and almost capture all of the Indian subcontinent (Abraham Eraly, 2000).<p> 
</p>This painting by Khem Karan, is just an example of the military dominance Akbar was capable of during his reign from 1556-1605 (Eraly, 2000). Emperor Akbar’s supposed military ability, is due in part of his prestigious bloodline that belongs to the notorious Ghengis Khan (Eraly, 2000). Ghengis Khan was the Mongol ruler that ruled most of modern Asia and Eastern Europe during his reign in the 12th century, and holds royal importance in the ancestry of Akbar (Eraly, 2000). Emperor Akbar also focused his regime on cultural integration, turning the Mughal empire from a secular to liberal society (Eraly, 2000). His effective social and political policies helped him win over the people of the Mughal empire, as he was the first ruler to unify the native subjects of conquered territories to the Mughal society (Eraly, 2000). Akbar was also fond of literature and religious history, as Akbar himself had a library that contained over 24,000 books of scholar research (Eraly, 2000). Akbar’s knowledge and liberal philosophy, helped the Mughal empire triple in size and wealth (Eraly, 2000). That without Emperor Akbar, most of the historic chronicles and religious freedoms that we see in modern India today could not be possible.<p>

  <summary>Conclusion</summary>
  <div>
  <p>The painting “Akbar directing attack on Ranthambor Fort” by Khem Karan, illustrated the significance of emperor Akbar’s conquest for power. As the siege on the Rajput fort of Ranthambor in 1569, was another example of Akbar’s triumphant battles that are described in the Akbarnama. The painting by Khem Karan, details the strategic chaos Akbar foregoes in his attacks, and shows the leadership that Akbar has with his troops. With Akbar on the cliff in white clothing, it helps paint Akbar as a respected and powerful leader. Which by looking at historical evidence, proves that Akbar is one of the most influential figures in Indian and world history. Through the people seen in this painting, it does illustrate the several religious backgrounds that were present in Akbar’s diverse army. Which proves as evidence of a multicultural society, which never happened before in Mughal empire history. Overall this painting helps us understand the importance of power and war to a Mughal emperor, and how emperor Akbar used his regime to unite the millions of diverse inhabitants in his growing empire.<p>
