    <summary>Introduction</summary>
  <div>
  <p>This miniature painting “Akbar and Surjan Hada” by Karan Khem is a narrative painting that depicts Mughal emperor Akbar's ingenuity and determination in military combat. It also moves through time from the preparation of the siege to the beginning of the battle of Ranthambore. The Indian miniature paintings are a good source of information about the kind of clothes worn by the Indian nobility, and the people whom served under them. The paintings are surviving examples of the fabric and style of dress that were worn throughout the hierarchy. This particular painting further serves as an illustration of the hierarchy within the military structure through the costumes worn by all individuals. It is one of the 116 miniature paintings from the Akbarname which has been held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in the UK since 1896.</p>

  <p>Akbar commissioned the work and Abul Faz’l was responsible for the writing of the manuscript. After Akbar’s death in 1605, the manuscript remained in his son Jahangir’s and then his grandson Shah Jahan’s library. Frances Clarke obtained it from her husband who received it at his retirement from serving as Commissioner of Oudh. Mrs. Clark then sold it to the Victoria and Albert Museum. All miniature painting have been stripped away from the book, and mounted separately for viewing.</p>
  <p>The artist, Karan Khem was one of the 13 Hindu artist listed by Abu'l Fazl as having obtained fame in Akbar's court atelier. According to Abu’l Fazl's Akbar instructed that many book be illustrated. Each week the several superintendents and clerks submit before the king the work done by each artist, and His Majesty gives a reward and increases the monthly salaries according to the excellence displayed.

  <summary>Akbar Altered The Mughal Empire</summary>
  <div>
  <p>The Mughal Empire was one of the strongest in India history. Its dominance between the 16th and 17th century significantly influenced the course of history for the entire subcontinent. Under the reign of Akbar the Mughal empire was altered, changing the military, economic, political and religious landscape of India and Persia. The Mughal's success in part was due to Akbar’s tireless determination, and his employment of innovative engineering which enabled him to sweep through and overtake many territories swiftly. This painting is a fine example of Akbar's ability to win against all odds by mobilizing an arsenal of large cannons into the field of battle. This strategy was a significant contributor to the Mughals' military success.

  <summary>The Western Seaport of Gujarat</summary>
  <div>
  <p>After Akbar had conquered Northern India he was looking to expand his kingdom to central and western India with the seaport Gujarat being of special interest as it was the gateway to trades and contact with the rest of the world. But the Ranthambore and surrounding areas ruled by the Rajput cast were in the way, therefore Akbar had to conquer these areas before proceeding to  this much sought after coastal region. Gujarat gets its name from "Gujjar Rashtra" or “Gujjaratta”, the land of the Gujjars. It is situated on the western coast of India. They were a migrant tribe who came to India in the wake of the invading Huns in the 5th century. The coastline of Gujarat is 992 miles (1,596 km) long, and no part of the state is more than 100 miles (160 km) from the sea. The capital is now Gandhinagar, on the outskirts of the north-central city of Ahmadabad (Ahmedabad)—the former capital, the largest city in the state, and one of the most-important textile centres in India. It was in Ahmadabad that Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi built his Sabarmati ashram (Sanskrit: ashrama, “retreat” or “hermitage”) as a headquarters for his campaigns against British rule of India.

  <summary>Military Stratagy</summary>
  <div>
  <p>The elevation of the Ranthambore fortress was a formidable challenge, and considered impenetrable, as it was purposefully perched above and away from all threats. This lofty height of the Ranthambore fortress was not the only challenge facing Akbar. He was employing a new method in military manoeuvres by mobilizing and including heavy artillery in his campaign to conquer more territories, which made this siege ever more remarkable. The cannons opposite the fortress are examples of this new military strategy, up until this time, cannons were stationary defence weapons to protect fortresses. They were not considered as a weapon to use in the field, and carting them to another kingdom’s fortress to do battle was not consideration possible or plausible. But Akbar, knew that in order to succeed in this take over, he had to be able to fight on the same level and have the same artillery power as the fortresses had. Although these newly designed cannons were for mobility, they still required a fleet of oxen and elephants to move them up this steep incline to the level of the fortress.

  <summary>Preparations</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Akbar set up camp by erecting tent that surrounded the fortress. In this painting there are colorful tents erected, and by their decorative bright style they possibly house Akbar and the higher ranking individuals.
  </p> 
  <p>Akbar utilized stone masons and stone cutters to erect battlements to shield his army. The wall reached the same elevation of the Ranthambore fortress quickly. In a short space of time the work was complete, and the orders to start firing began.
  </p>
  <p>This new concept of matching the military arsenal with that of the fortress proved to be a success and he conquered Ranthambore within two months.</p>
   <p>Ranthambore fort got its name from two hills - Thanbhor, on which the fort is built, and Ran, which is a hill on the backside of the fort. The Ran is the hill that Akbar set up his military defence. This siege was just a part of an overall campaign to secure not only as much of India as possible but to gain access to the West coastal trading routes in Gujarat in order to gaining access to the rest of the world, such as with the Ottoman and Safavids.

  <summary>The Mansabdari System</summary>
  <div>
  
  <p>Akbar brought the entire military organisation into a system, which was called the Mansabdari system. The holder of a mansab (rank) was in the service of the state and he was bound to render service as needed. All servants of the empire, whether in the civil or military departments were graded in this system. There were thirty-three grades of mansabdars ranging from 'commanders of 10' to 'commanders of 10,000'</p>
  <p>Appointment, promotion, suspension or dismissal of mansabdars rested entirely with the emperor. No portion of a mansabdar's property was hereditary. A mansabdar did not always begin at the lowest grade, the emperor, if satisfied, could and actually did grant higher or even highest grade to any person. There was no distinction between civil and military departments, officers both civil and military held mansabs and were liable to be transferred from one branch of the administration to another. Each mansabdar was expected to maintain prescribed number of horses, elephants, equipment etc according to his rank and dignity.</p>
  <p> In its broadest aspect, the mansab or rank awarded to an individual fixed both his status in the official hierarchy as well as his salary. It also fixed the number of armed retainers (tabinan) the holder of a mansab was supposed to maintain for the service of the state. The holder could be given any administrative or military appointment, or kept in attendance at the court. Thus, mansabdari was a single service, combining both civil and military responsibilities.</p>

  <summary>Military Dress Codes</summary>
  <div>
  <p>As in any society the Mughal costumes were the mirror of their civilization, as their clothes were the main sources to determine the polity, social status and hierarchy in thier society and help to determine economic status. Each characteristic of the dress within Akbar's military hierarchy distinctively separates the level of command.  </p>
  <p>Imperial and Higher Ranking Dress</p>

  <p> Beginning with Akbar, his clothes of that era definitely marked a distinct style in the way they were designed. In this painting he wears a jama of white fabric with a pyjama underneath. In Persian, the word "Jama" means garment, robe, gown or frock-coat with tight-fitting bodice, nipped-in waist and flared skirt, reaching the knees. The Yaktahi Jama (an unlined Jama) originated in Persia and Central Asia.

  <p>His turban studded with precious stones and the decorative sash (patka) around his waist mark his prestige and honourable persona. He often wore a long Kurta, on top of which he wore a jacket, which resembled the modern day Sherwani. All his clothes possessed intricate Zari or Kundan work, which brought out his majesty’s regal persona to the forefront.
  </p>
  <p>The mansabdar to Akbar’s right in his elegant green patterned rich textile appears to correlate with his a status of importance, as with others such as the man in the red patterned robes in the lower center. This man seems to be directing the men to his left with a rod. The men he directs are possibly lower status members, as they are dressed in plainer clothing.  
 </p>
 <p>Lower Ranks</p>
 <p>The lowest ranking men such as the boulder carrier and stone cutter wore very little clothing and were barefoot. In his diary, written no later than 1529, Akbar's grandfather, Emperor Babur remarked on the dress of the native Hindus: “Peasants and people of low standing go about naked. They tie on a thing called languta, a decency-clout which hangs two spans below the navel. From the tie of this pendant decency clout, another clout is passed between (the legs) and made fast behind.” What Babur is describing is more commonly called a dhoti, which is nothing more sophisticated than a length of fabric (usually cotton) tied around the nether portions like a loincloth. People in India have worn these since antiquity, as seen in the Ajunta cave-paintings dating from the 1st to the 6th centuries C.E.
