    <summary>Introduction</summary>
  <div>
     <p>The Akbarnama is the illustrated biographical epic describing the exciting life of Mughal emperor Akbar-spanning three volumes! Akbar became emperor at the tender age of thirteen, in the year 1556 (Guy). Akbar loved the fine arts, and asked that his assistants make him many beautiful illustrated books (guy). The illustrations adorning the Akbarnama are ornate, detailed, and regal. Mughal traditions emphasized the importance of recording family history to show political prowess, and Akbar certainly embraced this tradition (ibid).  Islamic royal courts were often centred around art, and this was certainly the case with Akbar and the rest of his fmaily line While Akbar's father, Humayun, had failed in some ways during his reign by losing areas of his land, Akbar's legacy is strong. It seems that his fathers losses drove him to be as powerful as possible, even as he took the throne at such a young age. However Akbar did continue a relationship with two great Iranian artists that worked for his father, Mir Sayyid Ali of Tabriz and Abd al-Samad of Shiraz, who helped to commission the Hamza-nama, which took fifteen years of work in the royal workshop! (ibid).<p> 
  <p>In the time between the publication of the Hamza-nama and the Akbarnama, Mughal art styles were expanded and deepened.  European art styles were blended with tradional  Islamic painting styles, and there was more of a focus on telling a good story through the illustrations. These miticulous art pieces were joint efforts, usually one artist would compose and outline a design and another woould paint the colours into the piece afterwards (ibid).  This particular painting shows Akbar and a group of followers leaving a palace and getting into boats as they make the watery journey to Agra to bring order and peace to the area.  The painting features four lines of persian text that describes the scene. One can tell from gazing at this work that Akbar is illustrated to be of central importance, as he is in the most comfortable position in all of the boats. There is merryment and excitement as colourfully dressed people scatter out of the building, and the boats overflow with supplies, people, and animals. Almost everyone's gaze is on Akbar, as they await intructions for the long treck ahead of them. You can see the signatures of the artists in red ink on the painting.<p>

  <div>
  <p>In addition to being a lover of fine arts like calligraphy and painting, Akbar was a big fan of beautiful architecture. During the time Akbar was alive, much like the skyscapers of modern day metropolitan cities, grand buildings were a way to display power and glory. When Akbar traveled to Agra, he expanded the city in magnificant ways.  One important building he commisioned was the Red Fort, constructing it right by the Jamuna River, with the dual roles of palace and fort (PBS). It took eight years to complete, but the results were worth it. The fort features ornate carvings, lattices, pavillions, canopied roofs, paintings, screens, pillars, and brackets (PBS).The deep red colour of the building comes from the sandstone it is carved from (ibid). Although Akbar pacticed Islamic faith in many ways, Agra also has a special place in Hindu spirituality. It is believed that it is a place where Krishna charmed the gopis with his magical flute (Latif,2).  Agra was also ruled by Lodi kings in a time long before Akbar, including one ruler Raja Kans who created a fort there to be a prison for his enemies (Latif, 2). Agra has a rich history dating before and after the reign of Akbar.<p>

  <summary>The Story of Akbar`s Journey To Agra <summary>
  <div>
  <p>Munim Khan, who was the governer of Kabul at the time of Akbar`s rule, invited Akbar to honour Agra with his presence, blessing the area with his leadership skills. This was due to some chaos and disorganization that was left in the wake of Munim`s son being in charge while he was away working. It only took a few days to make plans, and then Akbar and a group of loyal followers and attendents loaded up some boats and traveled to Agra on the ninth of April. It certainly was not a quick journey, but eventually the group arrived in Agra.  They were recieved with joy, and a grand feast and celebration was held. Akbar expanded the city with new buildings including the Red Fort.<p>

  <summary>Babur Crossing The River Saun<summary>
  <div>
  <p>A painting in the biographical book of Akbar`s grandfather,The Babburnama, depicts a similar river voyage that Akbar took to Agra.  The painting illustrating this event is titled Babur Crossing the River Saun.  Babur`s journey was a dangerous one, including crocidiles and choppy waters. In the story, he asks that his army forms a bridge with their boats to cross the waters (National Museum India). It is interesting that the crossing of rivers are such vital events in the lifestores of many Mughal rulers. It seems possibly symbolic, representing the daring leaders fearlessly embracing tumultuous waves and taking the hero`s journey to conquer a new place. In poetry water often is used as a metaphor for deep emotions, and while these Mughal river journeys are written as true events, the symbolism is still rich. Like a deep and flowing river, Akbar and his anscestors and descendents had to adapt to challenging twists and turns, as well as summon up a warrior passion to face not only their own inner fears but the trecherous journey ahead.<p>

  <summary>Mughal Art<summary>
  <div>
  <p>Akbar was not a fan of the Islamic tradition of not allowing portraits of people to be painted (Dalrymple). He believed that art brought people closer to God. The Mughal emperors were lovers of fine art, and put abundant resources into it`s creation. The collections of Mughal art that we have today is extremely vast, much of it is held in the British Library. Much of the art in the British Library was stolen by the British from the Persian Library at the Red Fort in Agra following the Great Uprising in 1857 (Dalrymple). The art that is stored in England is a collage of all that made up the Mughal empire.The paintings and calligraphy emcompass Mughal family trees, important events, the fashion and customs of the royal courts, as well as scientific and astronomical observations (ibid). <p>

  <summary>Conclusion<summary>
  <div>
 <p> Akbar was a revolutionary king. He stood for religeous tolerance, even taking on Hindu customs such as not eating meat (ibid). He also opened up a neutral religeous dialogue (something challenging to do even in modern times!) by inviting jesuit priests to particiapte in explaining the Christain faith to his court. He also reclaimed land that those before him had lost. Akbar ruled with both a fierce intensity, not hesitating to brtually slaughter his enemies, and loving kindness, spoiling his loved ones with generoisity. He encouraged religeous tolerence and freedom, and seems to have an open mind and a free spirit. Although the Akbarnama was obviously written to reflect him glowingly, the fact remaines that he lived a life of greate courage and adventure and it is fascinating to examine today. We are lucky that the Mughals were such creators and curators of art, as even their written descriptions would not come close to teaching us about their lives as their vibrant art does in such fine detail. <p>
