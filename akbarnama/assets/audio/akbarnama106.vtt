00:00:10.226 --> 00:00:20.840
The painting is made by La’l and Babu Naqqash around 1590 to show Akbar and his army fighting in the battle of Sarnal against Ibrahim Husain Mirza and his army

2
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:28.450
Akbar is a well-established leader, who is able to conquer mostly all of northern India with the help of his well-kept Mughal army.

3
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:37.011
The state of Gujarat had mostly been conquered by Akbar but the Mirza’s who are enemies of Akbar were trying to take it back right under his nose

4
00:00:37.011 --> 00:00:46.004
Upon hearing that Ibrahim Husain Mirza is in Sarnal, Akbar leads his troops on a conquest to find and kill the Mirza’s once and for all.

5
00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:55.862
It is said in the Akbarnama that Ibrahim Husain Mirza said that he saw the dust of the victorious army, which means he knew that Akbar was coming for him.

6
00:00:56.554 --> 00:01:01.829
This scene, shows a powerful Akbar in the center leading his Mughal army into battle.

7
00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:09.438
Dressed in armour from head to toe and the only one wearing a feather on his helmet and a gold extension from the helmet to protect his neck

8
00:01:09.438 --> 00:01:13.330
Akbar also rides a white horse that is also covered in armour

9
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:20.766
When given the news of Ibrahim Husain Mirza being in Sarnal, Akbar who sent most of his troops to fight in other cities

10
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:26.387
had only 200 troops to take with against just around 1000 troops of the Mirza army.

11
00:01:26.387 --> 00:01:31.057
Akbar’s troops were also well covered in armour along with their horses

12
00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:38.061
These mercenaries are also hand-picked and paid well to fight hence all the success Akbar has had due to these troops

13
00:01:38.061 --> 00:01:45.152
Akbar and the troops also hold spears which give them a reach advantage over the enemy and are light enough to move around quickly,

14
00:01:45.152 --> 00:01:48.179
with archers in the back to support.

15
00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:55.010
This scene, shows the terrain that battle was taken place on and how it played an important role in Akbar winning this fight

16
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.642
Sarnal falls in the desert area in the state of Gujarat

17
00:01:58.642 --> 00:02:01.669
This desert is very hilly and full of cacti

18
00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:05.560
The mahi river is also seen flowing on one side of the battlefield

19
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.613
Beyond the Mahi river are larger hills with some having flourishing trees and others with dead trees.

19
00:02:11.613 --> 00:02:17.839
People are also painted in black shadows in the distance on these larger hills looking like they are working

20
00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:20.866
In the very left corner a fortress can be seen

21
00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:27.092
In Gujarat, these fortresses were strongholds and those that controlled them usually were the ones that ruled that area

22
00:02:27.092 --> 00:02:31.070
With this terrain being hard to work with and it also being very narrow,

23
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:38.679
Akbar and his small army were able to move around a lot easier than the larger Mirza army leading to Akbar’s victory

24
00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:43.781
This scene, shows one of Akbar’s troops piercing one of the troops from the Mirza army

25
00:02:43.781 --> 00:02:48.278
with his spear that gave him the reach advantage over the sword in the enemy's hand

26
00:02:48.278 --> 00:02:54.936
There are also troops seen heading in front of Akbar which shows that they must protect their ruler while he fights with them.

27
00:02:54.936 --> 00:02:59.174
The cacti are also seen in great bunches throughout this part of the painting

28
00:02:59.174 --> 00:03:04.368
Some troop members are also carry swords but have a shield as well for extra protection

29
00:03:04.368 --> 00:03:08.772
Akbar and his army are able to fight off the Mirza army as seen

30
00:03:08.772 --> 00:03:13.269
and win the battle of Sarnal which leads to the conquer of the rest of Gujarat.
