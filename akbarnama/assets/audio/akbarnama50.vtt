00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:12.492
This illustration, made in 1565 by Basawan and Mah Muhammad captures a scene in the occurrence of a rebellion against Akbar and his loyalists.

2
00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:21.005
Akbar was elephant hunting when he heard the news of a rebellion, that prompted his return to his estate.

3
00:00:21.305 --> 00:00:40.300
The tapestries on his wall signaling that he is a man of the highest class; after all only the richest and most high class could afford the silk sheets brought in from the orient.

4
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.400
With the loyal retainers, they stood at the ready to aid Akbar to satisfy any of his requests.

5
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:55.500
To Akbar’s right, his royal advisors, or I guess you can say “right hand men” are present to counsel their ruler and take his orders.

6
00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:05.600
In this scene, Akbar has called a meeting with Mu’nim Khan, Khwaja Khan and his other royal advisors to address a plan of action in halting this rebellion.

7
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.971
Akbar at the center, deals with all the chaos between the advisors on the left side of the image and the soldier on the right side.

8
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.986
Though, there is not much difference in the manner of which all the loyalists are dressed, the positioning of each individual is crucial.

9
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:30.500
The royal advisors to his right, with the exception of his retainers, are standing closer to Akbar as they carry closer and stronger relationship with Akbar.

10
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.404
A relationship that allows them to have Akbar’s ear in circumstances such as this rebellion.

11
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.233
On the bottom right of the image, the soldiers are stationed, with neutral expressions.

12
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.527
The soldiers carry swords on their sides as if they are ready for the battle they are about to face.

13
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.350
Looking up to Akbar, some come across as waiting for orders to address this uprising.

14
00:01:52.762 --> 00:01:59.861
Whereas, some soldiers seem restless in beginning this war as they look to Akbar as the signal to the elephants.

15
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.579
Among the other soldiers the man in the middle, dressed in orange, presents to Akbar elephants ready for battle.

16
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.978
Historically, Akbar had a personal obsession with elephants, which makes the elephants in this image very vital.

17
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.922
These elephants wear a headdress and body armor that is traditionally only worn in preparation of war.

18
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.406
With soldiers already sitting upon their elephants, they are seen as encouragement for their ruler to enter war.

19
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.350
Ultimately, Akbar ordered Mu’nim Khan to go ahead to prepare for a battle.

19
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:39.350
Mu’nim Khan was loyal member to the Mughal empire and carried a very crucial position in advising Akbar.

20
00:02:39.755 --> 00:02:44.600
As a principle minister to Akbar, Mu’nim Khan came to be known as ‘Khan’I Khanan’.

21
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.791
Entrusting Mu’nim Khan with the task to setting up a camp for the army came easily for Akbar, due to the relationship they had.

22
00:02:53.078 --> 00:02:59.690
Dressed in blue in the image, Mu’nim Khan takes his order to travel ahead and set up a campsite for battle.

23
00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:03.044
He was later to greet Akbar’s arrival at the camp

24
00:03:03.444 --> 00:03:05.800
and enter war together.
