2
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:14.000
of Ranthambhor in 1569.

3
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:21.000
This piece made by Khem Karan, is part of a historic chronicle called the Akbarnama, which is named after Emperor Akbar.

4
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.446
The emperor Rai Surjan Hada who ruled the Rajput fortress, had executed the brother of emperor Akbar, due to a failed trade deal

5
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.326
that the emperor Rai Surjan Hada had invested alot of money and time into.

6
00:00:31.873 --> 00:00:39.676
The murder infuriated Akbar, and he planned this raid for several days after his brothers death, and the plans of leading the raid. 

7
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.411
This raid however was expected by emperor Rai Surjan Hada, and had prepared well before the raid.

8
00:00:45.726 --> 00:00:53.350
As noted in the Akbarnama by Abdul Fazl, that emperor Rai Surjan Hada had strengthened his fort in various ways-

9
00:00:53.356 --> 00:00:56.540
and had provisioned it, and having prepared for this raid. 

10
00:00:56.548 --> 00:01:04.483
This is the story of the ill-fated battle that Emperor Akbar had conducted, in order to take revenge for his brothers murder.

11
00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:12.144
In this scene, emperor Akbar is seen wearing the white robe on top of the cliff, ordering his army to shoot at the Rajput fortress while leading the raid.

12
00:01:12.323 --> 00:01:17.616
The white robe is noted by the fortress troops, and they start to focus their aim towards emperor Akbar.

13
00:01:17.901 --> 00:01:22.891
The scene paints a vivid picture of the battle, with smoke from the guns of the soldiers as they shoot the fortress.  

14
00:01:22.997 --> 00:01:30.750
Emperor Akbar hopes that with his troops shooting at the Rajput fort that its citizens and infrastructure will surrender, along with emperor 
Rai Surjan Hada. 

15
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:36.587
The fault of emperor Akbar is that he fails to take in the fact, that the Rajput fort has a wall and built-in cannons- 

16
00:01:38.026 --> 00:01:43.063
that prove to be superior, to emperor Akbar's soldiers and ammunition. As described in the Akbarnama by Abdul Fazl, 

17
00:01:43.245 --> 00:01:50.117
The Rajput fort soldiers were active in firing cannons, like a thunderbolt of wrath and burnt up the life harvest of the ill-fated enemy.

18
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.838
Therefore, emperor Akbar is seen talking to his generals about possible strategies to get around the wall and cannons on the cliff.

19
00:01:58.021 --> 00:02:03.584
While several soldiers are seen below, appear frightened of the fort and its cannons. 

19
00:02:03.858 --> 00:02:10.789
In this scene, it illustrates the continued raid of the Akbar forces on the Rajput fort of emperor Rai Surjan Hada.

20
00:02:11.134 --> 00:02:15.715
As emperor Akbar's forces have begun to travel down the cliff, and march toward the Rajput fort.

21
00:02:15.967 --> 00:02:22.099
But as they travel, they encounter several townspeople and become distracted by their barrage of insults and violence.

22
00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:29.780
This creates a problem in emperor Akbar's plans to raid the Rajput fort, which is motivated to take revenge for the murder of his brother.

23
00:02:29.943 --> 00:02:35.685
All townspeople such as farmers, ironsmiths, cooks, merchants, came into the middle of the town.

24
00:02:35.792 --> 00:02:43.715
Were responsible for the distraction of the Akbar soldiers, the townspeople disliked the Akbar kingdom, due to past differences and impressions-

25
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.552
of being a tyrant, so they were loyal to emperor Rai Surjan Hada, no matter the circumstance. 

26
00:02:49.826 --> 00:02:55.106
With the townspeople increasing in number, the Akbar soldiers were worried about not making it to the fort.

27
00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:03.233
With the sudden outburst of townspeople, they continued to march but ended up with little success, so they decided to retreat back to the hill-

28
00:03:03.374 --> 00:03:14.269
and informed emperor Akbar what had happened. In this scene, the Rajput fort is seen firing cannons at Akbar forces on the other cliff. 

29
00:03:14.451 --> 00:03:19.832
This scene also shows the high walls that surround the fort on the cliff, making it unconquerable on foot. 

30
00:03:20.106 --> 00:03:28.497
The fort also shows no civilians inside, which implies that the fort is still safe and yet to be attacked on foot by Akbar forces.

31
00:03:28.678 --> 00:03:39.713
While the Akbar soldiers inform emperor Akbar what had happened in the town on the march to the Rajput fort, emperor Akbar is struck by a cannon blast and falls of his horse!

32
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:49.245
After the sudden injury to emperor Akbar, all Akbar soldiers surrender and rush to help emperor Akbar and carry him off the cliff in a carriage. 

33
00:03:49.474 --> 00:03:59.507
As the carriage rushes away from the battle, the doctors in the carriage come to find that emperor Akbar is missing an arm, and perfusely bleeding while in excruciating pain. 

34
00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:02.973
The doctors of emperor Akbar panic, and they start to pray. 

35
00:04:03.246 --> 00:04:11.090
As they continue to travel to the medical center in the carriage, hoping that they can still stop the bleeding and save emperor Akbar's life.  

36
00:04:11.546 --> 00:04:19.572
The news of emperor Akbar's injuries travels to emperor Rai Surjan Hada of the Rajput fort, and he starts to celebrate with his family in his palace. 

37
00:04:20.028 --> 00:04:28.967
Just as they arrive to the medical center, emperor Akbar's doctors come and rush Akbar into the medical center, But as they enter...

38
00:04:29.058 --> 00:04:33.618
Emperor Akbar breathes his last breath and passes away in front of the medical center. 

39
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.546
While the doctors repeatedly call his name with no avail, the doctors finally give up and pronounce him dead on arrival. 

40
00:04:39.638 --> 00:04:44.938
Everyone mourns, as emperor Akbar is quickly covered up and carried inside.
