00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:12.650
Akbar, the Mughal emperor at the time, the man found at the center of this painting dressed in yellow and blue was en route to lead another campaign after defeating Daud Shahâ€™s attempt to overthrow his empire.

2
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.750
He, along with his men, hoped in boats on the Indus river and departed from Fatehpur to pursue his campaign.

3
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.300
The painting portrays the moment where the messenger stopped Akbar to deliver news to him.

4
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.530
Akbar and the courtier are engaging in a prayer upon receiving the news about the victory in Bengal.

5
00:00:28.537 --> 00:00:37.800
The way in which he is centered in the image and surrounded by the courtier displays his level of power of them and their respect for him.

5
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.410
This scene probably takes place somewhere near the Fatehpur district. This assumption can be drawn based on two things shown in the painting.

7
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.890
First, the unique and detailed architecture found in the building.

8
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:59.860
The structure resembles a palace and the attention to detail portrays a sense of importance. This is a type of building that would be found in the district of Fatehpur, a city home to the administrative headquarters of the Mughal empire.

10
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:09.800
Secondly, the courtiers, people who are often in attendance of royal events, appear to have gathered from somewhere near by to pray with Akbar about the good news.

11
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.260
This suggests that there is likely a city nearby where these courtier are from.

12
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:23.130
The courtier all have their hands placed firmly together for prayer. This group of royal attendants are demonstrating their appreciation for the victory.

13
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.720
The celebration can be depicted through their face expressions and their body language which both indicate a sense of peace.

14
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:42.390
The courtiers attention is diverted directly towards Akbar, with a space left between them that allows all the courtier to be able to see and appreciate the moment that they are all experiences with the emperor of the Mughal Empire.

15
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.000
Akbar's reinforcements on the other hand are expressing a very different mood.

16
00:01:47.000 --> 00:02:00.000
In contrast to the way that the courtier reacted to Akbar, Akbar's own men that are pilled into the boats in the bottom of the painting on the Indus river are displayed with body language that expresses a very different connotation.

17
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.003
They do not appear to be phased by Akbar's prayer, they are not participating in it and they seem to be busy in conversation and working on the boat.

18
00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:17.220
Akbar was known for his relationship with animals and the use of them in the Mughal Empire during this period. The painting depicts two important animals at the time.

19
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:30.490
Elephants for one, were seen as a form of wealth and used by royalty within the administrative district for transport. They were are like gold and armor to the empires, something to be won, and a prize with incredible value.

20
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:38.200
Horses on the other hand, although they are not alive in this painting but are found as decoration on the bow of the boats used by Akbar's men.

21
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:51.880
Cavalry during the Mughal period was essential to success, survival and also in order to maintain a thriving political economy. Horses were their primary tool, form of army and form of protection during battle.
