00:00:04.745 --> 00:00:11.637
Foster brother of Mughal emperor Akbar, Adham Khan would become famous for leading a successful invasion on Malwa.

2
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.995
Not only this but he was known for his outrageous behavior that would eventually lead to his demise.

3
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:29.450
For example, after a successful invasion, Adham kept the majority of the spoils for himself while sending only a couple elephants back to Akbar.

4
00:00:29.451 --> 00:00:31.451
It was a greedy move.

5
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:40.501
In this scene, which is painted by Sanwala, Adham Khan is married in 1552 during his fourth regnal year as general.

6
00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:53.506
Akbar arranged and married him to Javeda Begum who was the daughter of Baqi Khan of Baqlan, a man that was for some time a secretary to the Mughal prince Mirza Hindal.

7
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.350
 Emperor Akbar can be seen sitting in a throne in the upper middle of the folio.

8
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:07.307
To Akbar’s side is his foster mother Maham Anaga, her close proximity showing her importance in this scene.

9
00:01:07.347 --> 00:01:16.140
Maham Anaga was Akbar’s wet nurse who saved his life after his uncle made plans to kill him as a child, risking her own life while doing so.

10
00:01:16.837 --> 00:01:21.933
She was very committed to his welfare along with later on applying herself politically.

11
00:01:22.724 --> 00:01:27.650
Maham played a very important role throughout Akbar’s life and rise to the throne.

12
00:01:28.523 --> 00:01:35.553
It’s very possible without her powerful position her son Adham Khan would not have been appointed general.

13
00:01:36.168 --> 00:01:39.682
This further underlines her importance and power.

14
00:01:41.088 --> 00:01:47.591
Much later after Adham’s execution Maham would pass away due to the grief of losing her son.

16
00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:01.547
Behind Maham Anaga stand Adham Khan and his bride gazing at each other.

17
00:02:02.164 --> 00:02:07.172
In Adham's arm is a royal mace wrapped in many layers of fine textiles and fabrics.

18
00:02:08.137 --> 00:02:14.815
This mace is a symbol of his high rank of general, as ornaments are given to show status.

19
00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:23.493
Of course, It wouldn’t be a wedding without gifts. Princes and nobles would bring offerings to celebrate the wedding.

19
00:02:24.372 --> 00:02:32.456
There gifts would be covered in textiles and fabrics in order to conceal the contents similar to wrapping paper.

20
00:02:30.354 --> 00:02:38.898
Gold and gems were often showered upon the newly wed couples of the Moghul empire.

21
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:48.809
Mughal weddings were celebrated with extreme grandeur. Dancing, music and all sorts of festivities were part of the ceremony.

00:02:49.424 --> 00:02:56.541
Here, women dance to music from the band which is full of beating drums, horns, and a set of symbols.

23
00:02:58.562 --> 00:03:06.910
Besides music many would say the most important part of a wedding is the food. In Mughal tradition the feast was very significant.

24
00:03:07.736 --> 00:03:15.820
The Akbarnama reads in regards to Adham’s wedding “In a short time preparations for a feast were made and the marriage took place.

25
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.674
The lofty disposition of the Shahenshah made this feast the occasion of a thousand favours.”

26
00:03:23.905 --> 00:03:33.306
The Shahenshah is a title given to the persian emperor meaning “king of kings” who was the one that organized the lavish feast for Adham Khan’s wedding.

27
00:03:42.093 --> 00:03:47.980
The wedding was a happy occasion before the impending events of war and execution.

28
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.969
The colours, details, and two page folio show this scene as one of great importance.

29
00:03:56.111 --> 00:04:02.526
It’s shown this way even though the mention of Adham Khan’s wedding is only but a short paragraph long.

30
00:04:03.492 --> 00:04:09.555
This could be further evidence of the importance of wedding ceremonies in the Mughal tradition.
