00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:12.000
This painting depicts the fatal death of Adham Khan, thrown from the Agra palace terrace as a death sentance.

2
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:20.000
A deep-fueled jealousy of the Ataga Khan, Akbar's top confidant, and a craving for ultimate power begins this tragic story.

3
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.000
Adham Khan and his family were very close to Akbar.

4
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.000
So close in fact, that they considered Adham as Akbar's foster brother.

5
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Adham Khan had a very reputable position not only in the military, but in Akbar's life as well.

6
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:45.000
Akbar let Adham Khan become close with him and his work. Consequently, Adham grew greedy and sought out more power.

7
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
He had become increasingly frustrated with the influence that Shams al-Din Muhammad, 

7
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.500
also known as the Ataga Khan, had over Akbar.

8
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.500
The Khan Khanan, Mu'nim Khan, was equally envious and wanted the Ataga Khan gone.

9
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.500
Too cowardly to take actions into his own hands, 

10
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.500
Mu'nim Khan hinted to Adham Khan that he should do it himself.

11
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.500
Mu'nim convinced him that if the Ataga Khan was dead, Adham Khan would soon be promoted to the position of Ataga Khan himself.

12
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.000
"Intoxicated by youth and prosperity", Adham Khan and his two accomplices planned to murder the Ataga Khan.

13
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Unfortunately for them, the murder did not go over quietly.

14
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.000
One afternoon they barged into the royal hall during a court day where magnates were meeting.

15
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Full of rage, Adham Khan, dressed in green, stormed towards Ataga Khan, wearing yellow, with his dagger drawn.

16
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The room was full of shock and confusion as Adham threatened his weapon at Shams al-Din Muhammad.

17
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.500
"Why do you stand still?", he cried at his servant Kusham Uzbek.

18
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.500
Kusham obediantly drew his dagger and stabbed the chief sitter on the pillow of auspiciousness

19
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.500
to show the magnates that they were not there to play games.

19
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The Ataga Khan rushed to the door, trying to escape his own assassination,

20
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000
only to be met by another servant, Khuda Bardi, who struck him twice with his sword, brutally killing him.

21
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.500
Once Adham Khan realized what he had done, he knew his actions would have consequences.

22
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.500
He rushed out of the royal hall to find Akbar, who was resting in his bedchamber upstairs.

23
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.500
Akbar is dressed in brown robes with a translucent shall, giving him an aura-like presence.

24
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.500
He had been warned of the incident downstairs and met Adham Khan at the veranda.

25
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.000
Adham decided that he might as well get rid of Akbar too,
and attempted to grab Akbar by the hands.

26
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000
To his dismay, he was met by a single blow to the head from the fist of Akbar himself. Adham Khan was knocked out cold.

27
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Akbar sentanced Adham Khan to death right then and there for his reckless and ungrateful behaviour.

28
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:59.000
He ordered his servants, dressed in red and yellow, bind Adham Khan and throw him off the palace terrace.

29
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.500
Unfortunately for Adham, he survived the first fall. 

30
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.000
He was then dragged back up the stairs only to be pushed off again, head first, to his death.

31
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Around the scene on the ground, everyone fled from the palace in fear and despair.

32
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.500
This event revealed Akbar's true character as the ruler.

33
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.000
Akbar proved that he would not make exceptions for anyone, no matter how close they were to him.

34
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Anyone could be punished if they broke the law.

35
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Adham's greedy and power hungry motives ultimately lead to his death and the tarnishing of his good name.
