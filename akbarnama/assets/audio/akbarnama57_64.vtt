00:00:03.056 --> 00:00:09.017
This specific part of the Akbarnama takes place while Akbar is travelling to oversee his empire. 

2
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.042
He’s on his way to deal with a conflict posed by one of his generals, Khan Zaman.

3
00:00:15.602 --> 00:00:21.089
This is when he passes through a town named Karra, situated off the Ganges river.
4
00:00:22.832 --> 00:00:29.718
Akbar and his court were in high spirits and so they were celebrating at one of his homes next to the Jamna river. 

5
00:00:30.622 --> 00:00:42.006
This piece was made with opaque watercolour and gold on paper through the combined efforts of Kanha and Nanha, two of the many artists who worked in Akbar’s Mughal court during his reign.

6
00:00:42.996 --> 00:00:48.053
In total, at least 40 different artists contributed to the Akbarnama.

7
00:00:48.806 --> 00:00:55.305
A translation of the original text can be found in ‘The Akbarnama of Abul Fazl Volume 3.’

8
00:00:55.735 --> 00:01:02.557
What’s strange is that the corresponding text in the translation is very minimal – we don’t get very many details there.

9
00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:10.992
According to the translation, “From thence he turned his rein towards Karra, which is on the Ganges. 

10
00:01:11.358 --> 00:01:18.180
As the suburbs of the city became the place of his encampment he turned his attention to hunting in the neighbourhood. 

11
00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:23.000
It chanced that he spent several days in that delightful land

12
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.035
So why did Akbar feel the need to have his court artists paint this scene?

13
00:01:30.231 --> 00:01:37.181
Well, Akbar had a fascination with combat technology and especially with the production of firearms.

14
00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:44.433
In fact, it’s paintings like this that have allowed historians to study the particular weaponry from this era.

15
00:01:47.446 --> 00:01:55.839
The amount of detail in this image lets us get a closer look at all the traditional war techniques and technologies from the Mughal Empire. 

16
00:01:56.872 --> 00:02:04.231
For example, the men in the image are armed with bows and arrows, guns, spears, shields, and much more. 

17
00:02:05.178 --> 00:02:13.054
Some members of the army on the right are riding on horses and elephants, which were both used as a mode of transport during war.

18
00:02:13.936 --> 00:02:27.042
They also have an assortment of shields, banners, guns, bows and arrows, helmets, armour, as well as assistants and portable architectures to boost the movement of this large procession.

19
00:02:29.473 --> 00:02:41.137
Certain hand gestures were integrated into manuscripts of the time to show that a character was speaking and here, several different men seem to be giving directions to a portion of the soldiers.

20
00:02:42.936 --> 00:02:57.042
Certain hand gestures were integrated into manuscripts of the time to show that a character was speaking and here, several different men seem to be giving directions to a portion of the soldiers.

21
00:03:00.203 --> 00:03:08.552
The army on the left side has similar weapons, but they don’t need animals for transport and they have some built in home defense features such as what appear to be cannons popping out of the building and pots lined along the walls of the structure. 

22
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:16.450
The artists of this folio are two “Indian miniature painters” - Kanha, who was the outliner, and Nanha, who was the painter.

23
00:03:17.806 --> 00:03:22.475
Kanha also outlined the accompanying piece of this two-part image, which was painted by a different artist named Nandi.

24
00:03:23.056 --> 00:03:31.836
Kanha’s work is most recognised for his artistic approach to animal life. Before he outlined and contributed to images of wars and battles in the Akbarnama, animals were Khana’s main area of practise.

25
00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:37.302
Some of his animal-themed work appears in the Baburnama or the “Book of Babur.” Babur was the first ruler of the Mughal Empire and Akbar’s grandfather

26
00:03:40.272 --> 00:03:45.006
Here, the animals in this image are woven in with the action of the battle. 

27
00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:50.816
There is an elaborately dressed battle elephant in the middle right area of the image. 

28
00:03:51.311 --> 00:04:01.017
Its trunk is stretched over the large army, possibly Akbar’s army since they dominate a majority of the image and seem to be attacking some kind of settlement.

29
00:04:02.136 --> 00:04:06.267
Further down and also leading the charge are the warhorses. 

30
00:04:07.257 --> 00:04:14.186
Their armour consists of variations of gold and black, which could be a metal covering used to protect the animals. 

31
00:04.14.983 --> 00:04:22.041
The fish and crocodiles in the Ganges appear to be engaged in their own battle, chasing each other upstream. 

32
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:28.303
This mini-conflict joins the white expanse of the river with the overall battle scene.

33
00:03:29.745 --> 00:04:36.674
The scene has been linked to its surrounding landscape and battle seems to be a common part of nature in this image

34
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:49.349
There is a theory that Kanha and Nanha are in fact the same artist because their names sound very similar, and they also share certain artistic traits.

35
00:04:50.726 --> 00:04:55.224
However, this theory has been disproved by a simple red inscription. 

36
00:04:56.493 --> 00:05:03.476
Red inscriptions like this one can be found at the bottom of the pages throughout the Akbarnama.

37
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:12.590
These ones were written in Persian, probably by the librarian of the time in order to indicate the artist or artists who worked on each image.

38
00:05:13.537 --> 00:05:21.994
The inscription on this image includes both Kanha and Nanha’s names and this would only be the case if they were two different artists.


39
00:05:24.447 --> 00:05:34.195
The translation doesn’t say that each army was on a different side of the river, so why does it seem like Akbar’s army has to cross the river to attack their opponents?

40
00:05:35.357 --> 00:05:45.988
Khana’s work in the Akbarnama would come to influence the future of Persian painting because he began this technique of using “a blank middle ground to establish psychological space.”

41
00:05:48.635 --> 00:05:58.469
Therefore, the Ganges river’s centred location is not done to reflect the text, but to give each army its own mental and visual space in the scene.

42
00:05:59.308 --> 00:06:06.345
Kanha also used a “diagonal” direction in his work in order to allow the scene to flow beyond the limits of the margin.

43
00:06:06.948 --> 00:06:13.447
A close observation of the men’s hands on the left side of the image displays this diagonal orientation.

44
00:06:15.857 --> 00:06:21.387
The mind can continue imagining the scene spilling past the confinement of the borders.
