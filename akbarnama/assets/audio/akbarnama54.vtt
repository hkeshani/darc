00:00:03.042 --> 00:00:09.937
In this painting, the Ravi River splits the frame into three thirds with distinct attributes.

2
00:00:09.938 --> 00:00:18.348
This scene illustrates the moment that Akbar notices that two of his attendants failed to cross the Ravi River to get into Lahore.

3
00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:24.252
According to the story, Akbar placed his trust in the Gods “and put his steed to the river.”

4
00:00:24.253 --> 00:00:30.826
While the river swept gently over Akbar and his steed, the gods were not so kind to Yesawal and Nur Muhammad, 

5
00:00:30.827 --> 00:00:34.531
the two important figures which are shown drowning in the river. 

6
00:00:34.532 --> 00:00:43.870
Akbar is said to have spent the following days tending to the justices required for the status of his late attendants, as that was his nature. 

7
00:00:43.871 --> 00:00:52.902
In this scene, Akbar rides a white horse adorned with the intricately embroidered saddle, appropriate for his rank, and golden jewelry. 

8
00:00:52.903 --> 00:01:03.076
He is armed only with his gilded katar which, in combination with the absence of other weapons in the scene, would imply the safety of his company.

9
00:01:03.077 --> 00:01:11.191
In the painting, Akbar appears to be expressing his dismay to the only person who separates him from the drowning people in the river. 

10
00:01:11.192 --> 00:01:20.283
Because of the exchange on the riverbank, Akbar is depicted as empathetic with the people on both banks who are distraught from the event.

11
00:01:20.254 --> 00:01:28.857
In the bottom right of the painting, Akbar's previous entourage appears blissfully disconnected from the events transpiring behind them.

12
00:01:28.858 --> 00:01:34.655
As they are the closest members in the frame to the event, their ignorance is highlighted by

13
00:01:34.656 --> 00:01:41.723
the rest of the people depicted in the scene who are clearly reacting to the events as they are transpiring. 

14
00:01:41.724 --> 00:01:44.770
The composition of the painting, done by La’l

15
00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:49.227
directs the focal points of the scene from Akbar, and the man on the shore,

16
00:01:49.228 --> 00:01:52.497
to the conflict of the drowning figures, and into

17
00:01:52.498 --> 00:01:57.595
the resolution of the composition in the contrast of the aristocracy to the ordinary people. 

18
00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:10.374
Another contrast in the midst of the scene is how Akbar is depicted in order to selectively concentrate the viewer’s focus onto Akbar. 

19
00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:17.090
By placing Akbar in the centre of the painting on a white horse, above anyone else near the center of the painting, 

19
00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:27.581
and specifically away from anyone else with as large a silhouette, the painters distinguished Akbar as the intended initial focal point of the piece. 

20
00:02:27.582 --> 00:02:35.237
By setting Akbar as the initial focal point, the story of the drowning men is framed initially from Akbar’s perspective.

21
00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:43.470
Thus in the resolution, where the aristocracy is depicted as disconnected from the events around them, Akbar’s connection to the scene, 

22
00:02:43.471 --> 00:02:49.057
and the empathy that he expresses, is the story that is immortalized on this painting.
