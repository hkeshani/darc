00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:12.580
This painting is a narrative depicting a battle between Emperor Akbar and Ibrahim Husain Mirza in front of the fort of Surat.

2
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This battle came to be years after the MIrza's of Gujarat rebelled against Emperor Akbar.

3
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.880
In the 11th year of Akbar's reign, Mirza Muhammad Hakim, King of Kabul, marched against him.

4
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.500
His courageous efforts, sparked a rebellion that soon spread across the Mirza's lands. 

5
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.940
On the 17th year of the rebellion Akbar gained power of Amhadabad in Gujurat,

6
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:48.610
and now could focus his attention on capturing Muhammad and his son Ibrahim Husain Mirza who were stationed at the fortress of Surat

7
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:59.350
The Fortress of Surat is a small yet, strong and secure fortress. Built on the seashore in 947 AD it resisted attacks by Europeans for centuries.

8
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:06.350
The architect used the shoreline to build ditches along the edges of the walls. 

9
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.260
The doubled walls were 5 years thick, and totaled 15 yards. They were 20 yeards high. 

10
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.080
And they were formed by stone, chuman, and burnt bricks.

11
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.880
Each stone was fastened firmly with clamps of iron. 

12
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.430
The top tower, known as the chaukandi, is an invention of the Portuguese.

13
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:39.150
In this section we are witnessing Ibrahim Husain Mirza speaking with his father Muhammad Husain Mirza, about the advances made by the Emperor's Imperial army.

14
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.030
Next to it, in a later conversation, the two are witnessing the advances of the Imperial army.

15
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:53.750
Ibrahim anxiously points to the army in the imagined distance after hearing they were only 8 miles from the fortress. 

16
00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.970
Soon after Ibrahim leaves the fortress to cause distress in the nearby town of Sarnal,

17
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.290
while Muhammad is left to watch the battle that would later happen in the open plains near the fortress.

18
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:18.350
As Akbar advanced up the Mahindri river, he was informed that Ibrahim Husain Mirza had left to the town of Sarnal in attempt to raise disturbances and rebellion elsewhere.

19
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:29.490
While many of Akbars soldiers, remained stationed in Amhadabad, Akbar took a regiment of 200 to march towards Ibrahim.

19
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.352
Upon arrival, The Emperor sent 40 bowed horsemen on the banks of the Mahindri river,

20
00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:41.720
while his force of 100 crossed the river to attack Ibrahim in the town of Sarnal. 

21
00:02:41.967 --> 00:02:47.077
Meanwhile, Ibrahim Husain from illfatedness and shortness of vision,

22
00:02:47.078 --> 00:02:54.041
immediately prepared for battle and came out of the town and took post on rising ground.

23
00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.791
With his force of about 1000 horsemen Ibrahim Husain sent his army out in the open plain

24
00:03:00.792 --> 00:03:05.420
to meet Akbar's army who were steadily advancing. 

25
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.301
In the plains, the two parties met one another. 

26
00:03:09.302 --> 00:03:16.244
Ibrahim Husain attacked upon the regiment of 40 bowman while the rest of the Emperor's army circled back from Sarnal.

27
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.573
Along the uneven pathway hedges of thorns stopped the Emperor's horsemen from pursuing,

28
00:03:21.574 --> 00:03:26.959
so the Emperor himself along with Raja Bhagwan Das went to the front.

29
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:34.900
With three enemy horsemen approaching the two of them got caught in the thorns of the prickly pears.

30
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.345
Raja hurdled his spear and struck the one horseman while the other two tried to assualt His Majesty.

31
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.302
The Emperor; tiger-slayer and world-champion urged on his horse and jumped over the thorns and in front of the enemies. 

32
00:03:50.303 --> 00:03:57.546
Seeing the danger placed upon the Emperor, the inspired troops made a desperate onslaught of the enemy.

33
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:06.734
Disheartened by the current loses Ibrahim Husain retreated and fled to Sirohi by the way of Ahmagnagar.

34
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:13.734
Upon hearing this news wife of Ibrahim Husain Mirza took their son Muzaffar and fled to Dekhin. 

35
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:24.734
The Emperor in, his world-conquering mind desired that the pursuit should not be given up till Ibrahim hussain should be seized, but as the cup of his life was not yet full the darkness of night threw a veil over him.
