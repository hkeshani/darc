00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:14.405
The Akbarnama in itself, from which the imagery at hand comes from, is a symbol of power without any need to look further into it. 

2
00:00:14.405 --> 00:00:19.876
The lineage of biographies that come before it sets up the power and history of the book’s importance,

3
00:00:19.876 --> 00:00:26.950
within the time it was made and as a symbol of Akbar’s time living as we read it and look upon its illustrations today. 

4
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.500
This image depicts a hunting scene, taking place near a town called Palam, described within the Akbarnama. 

5
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.940
The scene takes place following the year 1568 after a strenuous takeover of the Chitor fortress. 

6
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.610
Victorious, though barely, activities such as this hunting scene would come as a welcome entertainment.

7
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:57.643
But even the enjoyment of a hunting trip works double as a show of power. This method of hunting that Akbar utilized was a Timurid form called the Qamargah.

8
00:00:57.643 --> 00:01:06.459
The form involved rounding up the hunted animals with the use of a big circle of people that would bring the prey into the center of the circle.

9
00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:12.547
The more important people, in this case, Akbar, could then enter into the circle to assume the role of the hunter. 

10
00:01:12.547 --> 00:01:18.921
Akbar can be identified by his center position on the page, as well as the adornments about his character. 

11
00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:27.099
Most differentiated from his audience is the plume from his hat, accentuated further by the jewelery teaming from the feather’s base.

12
00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:35.033
It is not to be left out Akbar’s more defining feature in this image: that his is the only one seated on horseback.

13
00:01:35.033 --> 00:01:39.025
His sword far outweighs the stature of any weapon of his audience members. 

14
00:01:39.025 --> 00:01:45.660
The jewels strewn upon the horse further accentuate Akbar’s status among those depicted in the image with him. 

15
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:52.187
His chiseled and determined gaze reminds the viewer of the grandeur of this leader!

16
00:01:56.231 --> 00:02:02.465
In addition to these particular elements that differentiate Akbar from the lower hierarchical characters,

17
00:02:02.465 --> 00:02:08.027
the overall composition of his audience encircling around him adds to his importance in this image.

18
00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:11.863
They frame his character and lead the viewer’s eyes back to him. 

19
00:02:11.863 --> 00:02:18.313
This is a time of celebration and joy! A man near the bottom of the picture plane enjoys a drink.

19
00:02:18.313 --> 00:02:27.495
Meanwhile, others are enthusiastically, actively taking part of the hunt and watching their leader Akbar. Everyone’s eyes are directed towards him!

20
00:02:27.495 --> 00:02:34.975
This shows his importance among them not only during the scene but also at the time of illustration later around 1590. 

21
00:02:34.975 --> 00:02:41.815
Even the animals seem to provide leading lines either exactly towards or leading back into Akbar’s figure. 

22
00:02:41.815 --> 00:02:51.182
It is worth mentioning again that Akbar’s lineage that was so important to him and to the Mughals after him. A sharing of qualities was prized!

23
00:02:51.182 --> 00:02:59.334
Ruby Lal explains the importance of hunting activities to Akbar. Hunting was something that Akbar’s ancestry took part in, 

24
00:02:59.334 --> 00:03:04.129
so it is even more important that hunting should be described and even mentioned within the Akbarnama,

25
00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:12.664
especially as an activity following victory and therefore a celebration. Even his use of a bow to perform the hunt is a call back to his ancestry. 

26
00:03:12.664 --> 00:03:20.175
as the skillmanship of using a bow is a powerful symbol that reflects his ancestors and again speaks to his power in this hierarchy. 

27
00:03:20.175 --> 00:03:24.172
As it is quoted within the translation of the Akbarnama, 

28
00:03:24.172 --> 00:03:34.050
 “From thence he went, hunting by the way, through Mewat, and after spreading the shadow of his justice of the city of Alwar, he moved further forward.”

29
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:44.982
Power and hierarchy are shown through these elements: formally, the leading lines and content, the decoration of Akbar and the encircling gaze of his audience. 

30
00:03:44.982 --> 00:03:51.124
This history of the hunting activity to the Mughal lineage shows both Akbar’s powerful hierarchy 

31
00:03:51.124 --> 00:03:57.584
as well as the importance and influence for Akbar to pay strong attention to his own lineage.
