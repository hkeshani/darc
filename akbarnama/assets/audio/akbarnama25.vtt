00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.000
This painting depicts the capture of Fort Mirtha in North-West India near Jodpur. 

2
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.580
It was captured by the Mughal forces and led by Mirza Sharaf ud-Din Hussain in 1561.

3
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:27.880
Shàh Bidgàh Khán and his son along with other nobles assisted Mirza Sharafu ud- Din Hussain in the capturing of fort Mirtha during Akbars reign. 

4
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:37.500
Once the nobles had reached the fort they thought that the conquest of the fort would be easy but instead they encountered some difficulties as the Rajputs put up a fight. 

5
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.540
When the imperial army realized that the capture would not be easy they decided to be smart about their attack and plan it out.

6
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.610
By not acting recklessly they hoped to eliminate any casualities that may occur during the capture of  fort Mirtha.

7
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.350
Mirza Sharafu ud- Din Hussain surrounded the fort and they placed a mine under one of the main towers. 

8
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:05.350
They filled the mine with gunpowder and set fire to it. BOOM! The tower erupted in flames!

9
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:14.000
The fortress was then surrendered and it was mutually agreed that the garrison would leave with their horses and arms but leave all of their property and possessions. 

10
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.500
Originally there had been a peaceful agreement in regards to the capture and handing over of fort Mirtha.

11
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:28.500
However, when the soldiers went to take possession of the fort Deo-dás, a Rajput, set fire to his property which was in the fortress. 

12
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.500
He set fire to his property to demonstrate his resistant to the surrendering of the fort. 

13
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.900
After Deo-dás set the fire he fled only to be pursued by the imperial army. 

14
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.000
Quite recklessly he all of a sudden turned around and begin to engage in battle with Hussain and his nobles. 

15
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.500
This battle scene is Deo-dás and the Rájpúts attacking the royal army. 

16
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.500
It was a bloody battle full of chaos as demonstrated in the painting because it was so unexpected. 

17
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:07.000
Many royal soldiers as well as Ràjpúts lost their lives including Deo-dás. He was thrown off his horse and then cut to pieces by the imperial forces. 

18
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:15.500
The royal army are the ones who are fighting wearing the gold like helmets while the Ràjpúts are mostly wearing white turbans. 

19
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.000
There are many horses depicted as horses were a common choice of animal for battle 

19
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:27.000
as they allowed their riders to engage in fast moving and smoother battle compare to those on foot or other forms of transportation. 

20
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:36.000
When the Muslims established the Mughal Empire they also brought with them alternate military beliefs that differed from the old ways.

21
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
They relied on their horses and fought in a cavalry way.

22
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000
This painting also depicts the use of swords, shields and spears by both fighting parties.

23
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.000
These weapons were extremely popular during this era under Akbars reign. 

24
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:59.500
In the end Mirza Sharafu ud- Din Hussain gained control of the fort and proudly accomplished his goal of its conquest. 

25
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.301
“In short, the other Rajputs escaped half-dead from the battlefield

26
00:02:57.301 --> 00:03:03.500
“In short, the other Rajputs escaped half-dead from that battlefield

27
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:14.000
and the fortress of Mirtha together with all its territory came into the possession of the imperial servants and was included among the dominions".
