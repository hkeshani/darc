00:00:03.252 --> 00:00:09.135
Akbarnama 76: Akbar’s entry into the fort of Ranthambhor.

2
00:00:09.135 --> 00:00:15.360
Our adventure begins with the Mughal emperor Akbar directing the attack of the imperial forces

3
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.858
on the Rajput fortress of Ranthambhor. Knowing that he would not be able to get

4
00:00:20.858 --> 00:00:26.720
close to the walls without the imperial guard knowing, he instructed Qasem Khan and the 

5
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.667
Hindu Raja, Todar Mal to construct sabats -or covers- for the artillery in order to 

6
00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:40.262
disguise the weapons. His tactic was successful, “In accordance with orders firing began.

7
00:00:40.262 --> 00:00:45.503
At every discharge there was a reverberation in the mountain, the ears of the solid rocks

8
00:00:45.503 --> 00:00:48.755
were opened and there was a breach in the walls of the fort and the 

9
00:00:48.755 --> 00:00:55.814
houses went to dust”. Raja Surjan Hara, the fort’s governor, sued for peace and agreed

10
00:00:55.814 --> 00:00:59.900
to a treaty – the only one of its kind ever signed by the Mughals.

11
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.179
The keys to the fortress were handed to Akbar, who entered it the next day.

12
00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:10.918
The creator of the Akbarnama, Abu’l Fazl notes that the only other Muslim conqueror of 

13
00:01:10.918 --> 00:01:16.416
Ranthambor had taken a year to achieve what Akbar’s forces accomplished in a month.

14
00:01:16.416 --> 00:01:22.513
After the short-lasting siege, it is said that “Surjan’s pride was shattered, and the

15
00:01:22.513 --> 00:01:28.995
fire of his disposition quenched”. He subsequently entered Mughal service, and he and his companions

16
00:01:28.995 --> 00:01:34.343
were given many privileges, including the right to carry arms in Akbar’s Hall of Audience.

17
00:01:34.343 --> 00:01:41.660
In Abu’l Fazl’s Akbarnama, this story is accompanied by the illustration you are currently viewing.

18
00:01:41.660 --> 00:1:47.885
This image shows the scene when Akbar infiltrates Ranthambhor. His troops rush up the hill 

19
00:1:47.885 --> 00:1:53.276
and through the gates of the fortress, many on horseback and all armed for combat.

20
00:1:53.276 --> 00:02:02.197
The men are brandishing many types of weapons including spears, bows, and swords. Surrounding Ranthambhor,

21
00:02:02.197 --> 00:02:08.593
Akbar’s artillery is hidden under sabats or tent-like structures. Aiming up at the walls

22
00:02:08.593 --> 00:02:13.792
we see an arsenal of cannons, that were instrumental in Akbar’s defeat of Surjan.

23
00:02:13.792 --> 00:02:20.295
The emperor is pictured inside the fort on horseback, as the imperial forces surrender to him.

24
00:02:20.295 --> 00:02:26.799
The image depicts the fort in a stylized manner that contrasts with the European influence

25
00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.655
apparent in the naturalistic treatment of the background, where a city is seen through

26
00:02:31.655 --> 00:02:38.886
“misty blue tones of distant Western landscapes”. The painting displays a multi-point perspective

27
00:02:38.886 --> 00:02:43.999
where the artist draws upon a number of details to signify the reality of the event.

28
00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:51.123
He utilized various types of perspective to present a panoptic narrative. The canons placed outside

29
00:02:51.123 --> 00:02:56.214
the tents are shown from an aerial perspective, while other activities are depicted on the

30
00:02:56.214 --> 00:03:03.317
same plane as the viewer. The artist relates scale to significance, as Akbar appears larger

31
00:03:03.317 --> 00:03:09.114
than any structure or being, near him. One’s eyes are drawn to the dominant ‘S’ curve

32
00:03:09.114 --> 00:03:13.970
that unites the top of the image with the bottom. In the book,


33
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.602
“Seeing Across Cultures in the Early Modern World”, art historians Dana Leibsohn and Jeanette Favrot Peterson

34
00:03:20.602 --> 00:03:27.084
state that “the issue is not an inability to understand the principles of European linear perspective.

35
00:03:27.084 -->00:03:33.588
Rather, for Mughal artists and viewers, it was the amalgamation of different definitions of “optical 

36
00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:39.556
accuracy” and alternate visions of representing truth that needed to be negotiated”.
