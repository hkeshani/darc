00:00:20.142 --> 00:00:26.442
This scene depicts an epic battle, set in a garden in the town of Patan.

2
00:00:26.442 --> 00:00:32.742
Bairam Khan and his companions were trying to enjoy a leisurely boat trip 

3
00:00:32.742 --> 00:00:38.232
when they were ambushed by a group of no less than forty Afghans.

4
00:00:38.232 --> 00:00:45.013
The Afghans were ready for battle, 10s of horse riding soldiers swarmed into the garden,

5
00:00:45.013 --> 00:00:48.325
 armed with long swords and bows and arrows.

6
00:00:48.325 --> 00:00:54.034
With their Swords drawn, and horses blazing, the fight took hold,  

7
00:00:54.034 --> 00:00:59.239
causing much disturbance in the formerly peaceful garden.

8
00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:07.849
This busy scene is contextualized with smaller people in the temple behind the wall of the garden.

9
00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:12.229
The smaller scene contrasts with the main scene of the battle, 

10
00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:19.523
showcasing the importance of the battle and assassination while acknowledging there are other people out and about.

11
00:01:19.523 --> 00:01:23.647
It is evident that the battle is causing a disturbance 

12
00:01:23.647 --> 00:01:27.666
as a man peeks out of a door to gaze upon the chaos.

13
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:34.000
The battle ensues throughout the middle of the scene and eventually your eyes draw downwards 

14
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.602
to Bairam Khan and his assassin at the very bottom of the scene.

15
00:01:40.602 --> 00:01:47.022
Bairam Khan was on a pilgrimage to Mecca, on the orders of King Akbar. 

16
00:01:47.022 --> 00:01:51.492
Akbar was unpleased with Bairam and sent him away on this journey.

17
00:01:51.492 --> 00:01:59.752
Banishing him from the Mughal Empire, Bairam Khan knew that when he left on his pilgrim that it would be his last time in the kingdom. 

18
00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:07.177
However, he did not know that his last days in the Kingdom would be so closely followed by his last days on earth

19
00:02:07.177 --> 00:02:13.222
His untimely death left behind a window and his 4-year-old son, 

20
00:02:13.222 --> 00:02:20.109
whom Akbar would end up caring for by marrying his widow and assuming responsibility of his son. 

21
00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:25.237
As our eyes are drawn down through the scene, 

22
00:02:25.237 --> 00:02:29.467
they focus on the boat with Bairam Khanâ€™s former companions.

23
00:02:29.467 --> 00:02:33.562
We can see the men looking to the left and to the right in confusion. 

24
00:02:33.562 --> 00:02:36.457
Attackers are coming from all around them.

25
00:02:36.457 --> 00:02:41.977
One man in the boat throws his hands up in surrender as soldiers board their boat.

26
00:02:41.977 --> 00:02:48.097
Perhaps he spotted that their leader, Bairam Khan has died and that the battle is lost.

27
00:02:48.097 --> 00:03:02.000
The Three men in the very bottom of the scene are fleeing, the time has come to run.

28
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.926
Bairam Khan lays dead on the ground, red blood staining his bright yellow robes

29
00:03:02.926 --> 00:03:09.453
The yellow is the brightest hue in the picture and therefore draws the eye to pinnacle of the scene.

30
00:03:09.453 --> 00:03:18.166
Avenging his father's death, the assassin Mubarak Khan Lohani, looks up in glee over his enemy.

31
00:03:18.166 --> 00:03:21.586
Wielding his sword above his head with excitement, 

32
00:03:21.586 --> 00:03:28.429
the assassin turns the other way perhaps ready to mount his horse and celebrate his victory.
