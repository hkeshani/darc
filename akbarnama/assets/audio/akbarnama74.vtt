00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:15.500
The Akbarnama explains the life of the Mughal emperor Akbar, with particular detail given to the battles and victories of the celebrated emperor. The Akbarnama is accompanied by various illustrations.

2
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.630
This painting illustrates the siege of Ranthanbhor, a fort located near Agra and built upon a steep, rocky hill. 

3
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.050
The fortress is surrounded by a high wall, “hence they say that all other forts are naked, while this is mail-clad.”

4
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:40.130
This fort is strategically important to Akbar’s conquest of the Rajputs; the Rajputs were a warrior community that held power over a region of India.

5
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.730
Ranthanbhor is held by Rai Surjan Hada, and is reputed to be the strongest fortress in the area.  

6
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:56.180
The fortress had been attacked before in a failed mission, so now Akbar has taken the defeat of Ranthanbhor into his own hands.

7
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:04.740
The lower right of the illustration shows Akbar’s army, firing guns and cannons from the bottom of the hill up into Ranthanbhor.

8
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:15.060
“The ocean-like army surrounded it […] They were active in firing cannon, and the thunderbolt of wrath built up the life-harvest of the ill-fated enemy.”

9
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:28.120
The militia are sheltered by high stone walls, built by command of Akbar; this demonstrates superior military strategy, as his army could approach the fort in relative safety. 

10
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.600
The guns are aligned along the walls, illustrating how organized and focused Akbar’s troops are.


11
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.880
The fort burns from the cannon fire; men reach out for help from a man riding an elephant

12
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:50.230
Elephants were prized possessions in Mughal India, and had immense ceremonial and propagandistic standing.

13
00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:03.460
They were often decorated with bells and sometimes even painted; this elephant is adorned with a large bell around its neck, and decorated with smaller bells along its front and sides.

14
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:13.150
Elephants were trained to stand strong and still, even amidst artillery fire, as a symbol of strength, wealth, and military power. 

15
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.350
The presence of an elephant in Ranthanbhor illustrates the importance of the fort to Akbar’s efforts of conquest.

16
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:30.330
Unlike the prized elephants of military successes, this elephant is shown in motion, turned away from the incessant fire of cannons,

17
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.740
half-reared on its hind legs, seeming to flee from the site of attack.

18
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:43.140
This upset stoicism of the elephant suggests panic among Surjan’s troops, foreshadowing the eventual defeat of the fort. 

19
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.180
From atop the elephant’s back, a high-ranking general — 

20
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.360
perhaps even Rai Surjan himself, judging by his gold armour — 

21
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:59.770
 views not only the Rajput troops, but also Akbar’s troops below. He has his back turned

22
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:09.660
to the barrage of guns from the opposing army, and allows his elephant to flee, signalling his own realization that Ranthanbhor’s defeat is inevitable.

23
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:18.030
As the siege and the barrage of cannon fire continues, Ranthanbhor begins to show signs of defeat.

24
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:26.610
In the background, a piece of the building falls into the courtyard. Smoke billows from the fires, while men leap closer to safety.

25
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:34.940
The army of Ranthanbhor is in a state of chaos, some soldiers running for cover, some surveying the troops below.

26
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.400
Men fall from the fort, tumbling down the rocky hill, some covered in blood.

27
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:56.080
Below, Akbar’s troops are organized; the gunmen are all aligned; soldiers charge ahead ith spears and shields; and still farther below more army men and nobles are gathered under tents.

28
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.820
This insinuates the inferiority of Surjan’s troops, and the superiority of Akbar’s troops.

29
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.330
Indeed, the details and composition of the painting solidifies Akbar’s military prowess.
