00:00:0.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The emperor Akbar was a great and powerful leader, the third in a generation of 

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Mughal rulers. One day a problem was presented to him. Munim Khan, who was a 

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
governor of Kabul, had been asked by Akbar to come to Delhi, and in his 

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
absence Munim Khan left his son Ghani Khan in charge. In addition, he also left 

5
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
someone to help his son make decisions, Haidar Muhammad . However both these young men were 

6
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
too childish and chaos befell the area. Ghani Khan sent a petition to the court stating 

7
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.350
that Haidar Muhammad was not doing well at his job. Munim Khan suggested that Haidar

8
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Muhammad be summoned to Akbar’s court. a group of troops was gathered to travel to 
9
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
to Kabul to help them. His Majesty spent a few days in Delhi and then 

10
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
the journey began on April 9th, as the group traveled to Agra. The nobles and 

11
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
pillars of Akbar’s court made the journey by water and more people followed by land. 

12
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
This painting depicts the watery journey that Akbar and his followers took to Agra. In 

13
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
the upper part of this painting,designed by Tulsi in 1590-95, it shows a large 

14
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
group of people parading out of a fortress. This building has beautiful domes that reach 

15
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
for the sky and the people exit out of a doorway that looks like it has an intricate tile mosaic above it. 

16
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
In the largest boat in the painting sits Akbar, on an elevated, cushioned royal seat 

17
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
A myriad of attendants fawn over him. It appears that they are fanning him, rowing 

18
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
rowing the boat, and hanging on to his every word.  The man in front of him, based 


19
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
on his hand gestures, appears to be talking to him. He may be giving Akbar 

20
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
guidance for the journey. Also, Akbar’s boat is the only one that has a covering

21
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
to protect from the sun. The lower half of the painting is vibrant and eye catching. 


22
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The men wear a variety of brightly coloured tunics. They row their boats through choppy, 

23
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
fish filled waters. Possibly the rough river could indicate a tumultuous journey, but the fish

24
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
leaping up show an abundance of resources. In tow these men also have horses and 

25
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
hawks in their boats, as well as baskets of supplies. The people that are not 

26
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
occupied steering the boats or handling the animals seem to have their gazes fixated on 

27
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Akbar, as if waiting for instructions or admiring him. There also seems to various skin 

28
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
tones in the characters of this painting, perhaps showing the multiculturalism of the Mughal 

29
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
empire. Finally, the group arrived at Agra! It was beautiful, and they all experienced great healing 

30
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and abundance.  This was a fortunate time indeed. Akbar took positive leadership here, really focusing

31
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
on education, both of spiritual and worldly topics. They also built wonderful houses there

32
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Munim Khan invited Akbar to his home for a special dinner. Akbar accepted, and the 

33
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
“mansion received celestial glory by the radiance of His Majesty the Shahinshah advent.” There were 

34
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
beautiful gifts and a grand celebration, and everyone was very happy.
