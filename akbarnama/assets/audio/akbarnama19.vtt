00:00:06.831 --> 00:00:12.128
The year was 1561. The death of the Mughal Wakil, Khan Bairam, led to increased factionalism

2
00:00:12.128 --> 00:00:17.286
amongst the powerful nobles. As a result, they saw the absence of a powerful figure as an

3
00:00:17.286 --> 00:00:23.699
opportunity to act independently, in disregard of imperial interests. The post of the Wakil,which was

4
00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.972
the most prestigious post in the empire, involved a combination of military, financial and administrative power.

5
00:00:29.972 --> 00:00:35.362
It was a position highly sought after. Due to its vacancy, and the power that comes

6
00:00:35.362 --> 00:00:40.520
with it, it became a point of conflict between the various powerful factions within the Mughal empire.

7
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.840
The scene illustrated in this particular painting centres on two figures entering a walled compound in

8
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.673
the city of Kara on an elaborately dressed elephant. Their hands  were covering their head,

9
00:00:51.673 --> 00:00:57.714
seemingly bowing in shame and regret. The two figures shown here were Uzbek nobles known as Ali Quli Khan

10
00:00:57.714 --> 00:01:03.104
and Bahadur Khan. The Uzbeks were known as the most ‘turbulent’ and ‘untrustworthy’ of all the

11
00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:10.028
Mughal officers, as has always been the case due to the faction’s traditional antipathy towards Babur’s ruling lineage.

12
00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:15.836
Ali Quli Khan and Bahadur Khan were brothers as well as Mughal officers. During an Afghan Insurgency 

13
00:01:15.836 --> 00:01:22.156
in 1561, the two brothers were sent to repel an afghan attack at Jaunpur and were successful.

14
00:01:22.156 --> 00:01:29.266
Ali Quli Khan and Bahadur acted independently in disregard of imperial interests when they decided to keep the treasures

15
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:36.329
and war elephants they had acquired during the attack for themselves, sending a false booty report to the central court.

16
00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:43.299
Upon finding out that the Uzbek brothers acted on self-interests in keeping the war booty to themselves,

17
00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.968
Akbar made a forced march towards Kara with the intent of disgorging the Uzbeks of their treasures.

18
00:01:48.968 --> 00:01:55.195
Akbar marched to punish them for their insolence, in hopes that they would apologize and pay the shahinshah homage

19
00:01:55.195 --> 00:01:58.169
As stated by Akbar himself in his memoir, 

19
00:01:58.169 --> 00:02:01.236
"If any portion of goodness remain in that evil nature,

20
00:02:01.236 --> 00:02:05.046
and he awakes from the slumber of negligence and hasten to do homage,

21
00:02:05.046 --> 00:02:08.764
I shall draw a line of forgiveness over his offences and come back,

22
00:02:08.764 --> 00:02:11.552
for he is a plant which we have grown”.

23
00:02:11.552 --> 00:02:18.429
Upon hearing about Akbar’s arrival at Kara, Ali Quli and his brother Bahadur, became suddenly afraid

24
00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:24.842
of the possible consequences that may befall them and so marched towards Kara with their acquired elephants and war treasures.

25
00:02:24.842 --> 00:02:29.210
As can be seen in the picture, behind the brothers were two men with a 

26
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.299
green and a blue robe holding basket trays carrying what seemed to look like gifts.

27
00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:39.061
Although unseen in this painting, everyone is facing Akbar who is depicted in another painting seated on

28
00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:45.009
a second floor balcony holding a forgiving open hand gesture pointed towards the brothers. 

29
00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:51.003
As the brothers awoke “from their slumber of negligence” and paid homage to the great shahinshah in public 

30
00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:55.046
to show their respect and submission, they were forgiven by Akbar’s merciful nature,

31
00:02:55.046 --> 00:02:59.507
who himself said that: “the wondrous tree of humanity was the precious nursling of god.

32
00:02:59.507 --> 00:03:02.295
How unpleasant it is to uproot the flowers and grasses.

33
00:03:02.295 --> 00:03:07.453
It may be judged then what will be the result of uprooting a tree such as man".
