00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.632
The Mughal emperor Akbar loved to tell his experiences and successes as a ruler and to have them known far and wide.

2
00:00:10.632 --> 00:00:17.100
He commissioned his good friend and confidant Abu-l-Fazl to record and illustrate the happenings of his life.

3
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.912
One of Akbar’s favourite things to do was hunt.

4
00:00:20.912 --> 00:00:29.400
This scene, which was illustrated for Akbar by Basawan and Tara the Elder, takes place in the Narwar District in Gwalior, India.  

5
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.554
Akbar and his party were making their way though Narwar, hunting as they went. 

6
00:00:34.554 --> 00:00:41.154
Suddenly, a ferocious mother tiger and her cubs jumped out of the bushes and attacked him and his party.

7
00:00:41.154 --> 00:00:44.078
Everyone froze in fear and surprise.

8
00:00:44.078 --> 00:00:45.859
Everyone except Akbar! 

9
00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:53.425
Leaping courageously forward, Akbar faced the fearsome tiger and slew her with one stroke of his sword.

10
00:00:53.425 --> 00:00:56.526
Galvanized into action by their emperor’s brave deed, 

11
00:00:56.526 --> 00:01:03.526
the rest of Akbar’s fighting men leaped forward to take on the tiger’s cubs, slaying every last one. 

12
00:01:03.526 --> 00:01:09.671
By his brave actions, Akbar saved the rest of his party from an almost certain death.

13
00:01:09.671 --> 00:01:15.265
This great display of swordsmanship illustrates to anyone who reads the passage and sees this painting 

14
00:01:15.265 --> 00:01:18.588
how Akbar takes care of and protects his people. 

15
00:01:18.588 --> 00:01:24.453
The people of his empire would see this from far an wide and trust him as their ruler.

16
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.970
The hunt is used as a metaphor for his strength and ability to overcome his enemies

17
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:55.290
no matter how strong or terrifying they may be.

18
00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:06.350
For just as he bravely faces danger and risks his life to protect the people travelling with him,

19
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.490
so, too, does Akbar risk his life for the wellbeing of his empire and its citizens. 

20
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:21.352
And just as he and his men fight and kill a tiger and her cubs,

21
00:02:21.355 --> 00:02:24.720
so, too, does he courageously lead his men into battles and defeat his enemies. 

22
00:02:24.967 --> 00:02:32.077
What people wouldn’t want this man as their leader?

23
00:02:32.078 --> 00:02:37.041
This illustration of Akbar’s might also maintains his divine right as ruler of the Mughal Empire to its citizens. 

24
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.791
This solidifies his claim to the throne and increases his peoples’ loyalty towards him. 

25
00:02:44.792 --> 00:02:49.420
Think of the awe experienced by those who witnessed this event and the stories they would tell their friends. 

26
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.301
No one but a man with “the strength of the lion of God in his arms 

27
00:02:57.301 --> 00:03:09.244
and the coat of mail of the Divine protection on his breast”, could have beheaded 

28
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.573
such a fearsome monster with just one stroke of his sword and lived with not a single scratch on him.

29
00:03:16.574 --> 00:03:22.959
This poor man certainly couldn’t.

30
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:32.900
It seems clear then, that Akbar commissioned this book and its accompanying illustrations partly as a sort of propaganda, 

31
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.345
a way to impress his people and ensure the loyalty of those around him. 

32
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:51.302
Illustrations like this one and the descriptions that accompany them show Akbar’s courage in the face of danger, 

32
00:03:51.303 --> 00:04:00.546
his power and might in the midst of battle, and his selflessness and protectiveness of his people. 

33
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:10.734
All of these qualities are seen and heard by his citizens 

33
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:10.734
and lead them to trust in his leadership and skill and to be happy with him as their emperor.
