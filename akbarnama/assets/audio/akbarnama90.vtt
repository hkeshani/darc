00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:09.462
This scene, illustrated for Akbar by the artists Miskina and Banwali around 1590, 

2
00:00:09.463 --> 00:00:14.556
takes place at Karra in Northern India in the year 1567.

3
00:00:14.557 --> 00:00:15.024
This man dressed in green is Mirza Rezavi Mirak.

4
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.914
And this is an elephant tasked with his execution.  

5
00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:27.839
You might be wondering how Mirak got himself into this predicament.

6
00:00:28.514 --> 00:00:37.094
Mirak was a close follower and companion of Ali Quli Shaibani, a brave warrior in Akbar's military campaigns.

7
00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:43.559
Shaibani earned the title Khan Zaman as well as a plot of land due to his wartime success.

8
00:00:44.022 --> 00:00:49.000
Khan Zaman, however, was not always sure where his loyalty lie, 

9
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.527
or at least that is what  his rebel behaviour indicated.

10
00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:58.777
However, Mirak believed wholeheartedly that Khan Zaman was to be trusted by the empire,

11
00:00:58/780 --> 00:01:04.759
and so he stood up for him in front of Akbar's court and pleaded for his companion's life. 

12
00:01:04.782 --> 00:01:11.922
Akbar, this time, was merciful and granted Khan Zaman grace due to Mirak's efforts on his behalf.

13
00:01:12.342 --> 00:01:21.825
Unfortunately, Akbar's goodwill was wasted, for Khan Zaman's loyalty to the empire again faltered in the year 1566, 

14
00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:25.735
and he was deemed both a rebel and a disgrace.  

15
00:01:26.914 --> 00:01:33.942
Among his misdemeanors was scandalous sexual behaviour including overt displays of homosexuality

16
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.236
with none other than Akbar's young and attractive bodyguard, Shaham Beg.

17
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.492
It would appear that Khan Zaman was not deserving of Mirak's loyalty and defense.  

18
00:01:45.453 --> 00:01:53.000
In the Akbarnama, Abu'l Fazl explains that according to Akbar's orders, Khan Zaman was hunted down and

19
00:01:53.068 --> 00:01:59.693
"trampled under the foot of the elephant, or rather, under the weight of his sins and ingratitude" 

20
00:02:00.785 --> 00:02:05.153
As we can see in the depiction here of Karra in 1567, 

21
00:02:05.363 --> 00:02:10.617
elephants were commonly used as a means of corporal punishment during the reign of the Mughals.

22
00:02:11.017 --> 00:02:15.869
They were chosen over other wild beasts for the fact that they were easily trained,  

23
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.335
making them swift and obedient deliverers of justice and divine retribution.

24
00:02:21.456 --> 00:02:25.660
This training paradigm worked to Mirak's advantage in our tale.

25
00:02:26.526 --> 00:02:36.058
As the story goes, following Khan Zaman's brutal death, Akbar set his sights on squashing the rest of the rebel uprising in Karra,

26
00:02:36.316 --> 00:02:40.776
for Akbar believed that Mirak was a guilty party in all of this.  

27
00:02:41.823 --> 00:02:45.993
According to the Akbarnama and the accompanying depiction here, 

28
00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:54.116
all of the other perceived rebels were killed by means of elephant execution while Mirak waited to learn his fate.  

29
00:02:54.717 --> 00:03:03.012
Finally, when all others had perished, an elephant took hold of Mirak and flung him from side to side with his trunk,

30
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.629
not just for one day, or two, but a total of five days, with no reprieve. 

31
00:03:11.841 --> 00:03:18.339
He did not die, however "as a clear sign for his execution had not been given" by the driver,

32
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.463
so accordingly, "the elephant played with him and treated him gently"

33
00:03:24.523 --> 00:03:34.135
At last, Akbar did eventually decide to spare Mirak's life and the elephant executioner was ordered by its master to release him.

34
00:03:34.197 --> 00:03:41.428
This was a strategic move by Akbar, as it not only positioned him as an all-powerful ruler,

35
00:03:41.647 --> 00:03:49.067
but also ensured Mirak's unfailing loyalty to the empire because his life was now indebted to Akbar.

36
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.609
So although Akbar ordered the attack, he was also responsible for its end, 

37
00:03:55.864 --> 00:04:03.072
and thus the end of Mirak's fearful dance with death, granting him a new chance to prove his loyalty.
