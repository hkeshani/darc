00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:08.920
Now the story of an extraordinary Mughal who did everything

2
00:00:08.922 --> 00:00:13.840
and the one biographer who had no choice but to write it all down.

3
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.180
It's stories from Akbarnama……….

4
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:38.060
This is Akbar.  He is a respected, noble, intelligent and skilled Mughal emperor. Right now, he's riding a wild elephant who's out of control. Yes, you heard me right, a wild elephant, out of control.

5
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.370
Akbar: I'm the king of the world!

6
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.790
And he seems to be very happy

7
00:00:46.440 --> 00:01:00.000
This is his prime minister. He by the way is not happy.It's hard running a gigantic empire, that's constantly expanding while having to babysit an adventurous king.

8
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.500
And Akbar's is by no means making his job any easier.

9
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.040
Khan: what are your doing your majesty. please stop this!
(To himself) ugh I'm too old for this!

10
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And these are the unfortunate souls who were caught in the middle of the chaos. 

11
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.000
Let me assure you, that they, are terrified.

12
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.000
Person 1: Get out of the way!

13
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.030
Person 2: I'm too young to die!.

14
00:01:31.032 --> 00:01:33.750
Person 3: I can't swim!

15
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.754
Person 4: Tell my wife I love her!

16
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:42.290
So how did this all start? Ahhh let me take you back a few hours.

17
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.350
Like how every story goes,it started out as a pretty normal day

18
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:57.470
Akbar was hanging out in his palace, walking around the royal gardens and doing things normal emperors would do.

19
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.352
This all went south the moment he decided it was a great day for some elephant dueling

20
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.720
Like the time when Humayun decided to ascend a narrow staircase in a hurry and...... We all know how that turned out.

21
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.000
Ahem… so getting back to the to the story

22
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:36.041
 Akbar without any hesitation mounted the wild elephant Hawai (who by the way is a ferocious beast that will kill anyone or anything that comes in his way…so you get the picture) and faced off against an equaly terrifying elephant Ran Bhaga. 

23
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.791
Two words …. Bad Idea

24
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.420
In an instant Hawai began chasing after Ran bhaga, in high speed. That's when things turned from bad to worse..

25
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.301
Bringing us to this lovely scene of chaos and panic.

26
00:02:57.301 --> 00:03:02.250
People were running everywhere trying not to get trampled to death.

27
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.000
Some even jumped in the water while others rowed away from the action.

28
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
You know the saying when it rains it pours?

29
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:20.900
Well…. just when you think that things couldn't get any worse, the bridge suddenly collapsed under the weight of the elephants.

30
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.345
Even the word horror, was an understatement to describe this scene

31
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:34.302
Surprisingly, despite all the odds stacked against him, Akbar managed to chase away ran bhaga and win the duel.

32
00:03:35.303 --> 00:03:43.546
Although Akbar often took on some questionable pursuits, he was a brave man who knew how to test the limits of his bravery.

33
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.734
In the end everting worked out ok

34
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:55.734
His prime minster was relieved, the citizens were inspired and Akbar safe.

35
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.734
Strange how things often work out for the best.
