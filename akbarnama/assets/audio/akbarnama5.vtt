00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.200
This is the story about the death of Bairam Khan.

2
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.500
At the beginning of his reign, Akbar was young and inexperienced.

3
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:23.000
Thus, Bairam Khan, a close ally and companion of Humayun and who is depicted here, became Akbar's mentor, advisor, and guardian.

4
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.900
It was Humayun who honoured Bairam Khan with the title of Khan Khanan, meaning, "the king of kings".

5
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:38.700
Although Bairam Khan's time in power was fairly brief - that is, roughly five years, he was an essential part of the Mughal Military force.

6
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:48.000
In fact, without him, the Mughal Army would have never defeated Hemu, or reclaimed Delhi or Agra.

7
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.700
Bairam Khan was a great leader and commander, but as time progressed and Akbar matured, he demanded more and more autonomy.

8
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.000
Now, Akbar wanted to be king not only in name, but also, in reality.

9
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.100
Akbar's mother, Mariam Makani, was not an advocate of Bairam Khan.

10
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.900
She opposed many of his views and decisions, and consequently, decided to form a political alliance against him.

11
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.500
With strong influences from his mother, and various other disagreements...

12
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.200
Akbar eventually dismissed Bairam Khan, and sent him and his family on a pilgrimage to Mecca.

13
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.900
On his journey, he arrived at Patan, a city not far from Gujarat, and decided to stay a few days to rest and relax.

14
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.200
There, he would frequently go visit the beautiful gardens.

15
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:46.000
One day, he decided to go to the great pond, which had a pavilion that could be reached by boat.

16
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.700
In this scene, which was illustrated for Akbar by Tiriyya and Tulsi, between 1590 and 1595,

17
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.000
Depicts the moment of Bairam Khan's assassination.

18
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.300
As Bairam Khan was approaching the boat, a crowd of Afghans surrounded him,

19
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:10.990
One of them being Mubarak Khan Lohani, a man whose father had been killed in a previous battle, in which Bairam Khan was in command.

19
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.737
Strangely enough, it appeared that the Afghans has come to pay their respects.

20
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.800
So, without hesitation, Bairam Khan called to them.

21
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:28.300
As one man approached, presumably Mubarak Khan Lohani,he drew his hand in what appeared to be a salute.

22
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:37.500
Then, feulled with revenge, he struck Bairam Khan on his back with such intensity, that the dagger came out of his chest.

23
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.200
Years before, it was Bairam Khan that had said...

24
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.900
"We wish for martyrdom, but not in such a hurry".

25
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.300
So it may have been sooner than expected, but Bairam Khan got his wish, and had the bliss of martyrdom.

26
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.800
When the news made its way back to Akbar, he was devastated.

27
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.900
The new Punjab governor, Khan A'azim Atga Khan, was greedy and informed Akbar that Bairam Khan's death was due to treason,

28
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.500
and suggested that he be given the position of Khan Khanan.

29
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.200
Not surprisingly, Akbar refused.

30
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:25.100
Instead, as a sign of devotion and loyalty to Bairam Khan, Akbar took in his son, 'Aburrahim'.

31
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.200
'Abdurrahim was safely brought to the Royal Court of Akbar, where he was given the title of "Mirza Khan".

32
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.143
Later, he became an important part of Akbar's administration, and became one of the nine prominent ministers,

33
00:03:037.145 --> 00:03:041.000
called the Navaratnas, or "nine gems".
