    <summary>Introduction</summary>
  <div>
      <p>The Akbarnama is the biography of the third Mughal emperor named Akbar which was recorded by Abdul Fazl. The written version was comprised of three volumes written in Persian and took seven years to compile. The first volume contained the lineage and birth of Akbar, The second was a record of all of Akbar’s reign and the third volume detailed the administration system of the empire. After the written version was completed Akbar had the Akbarnama illustrated. In total 116 miniature paintings were created between 1592 and 1594 by 49 different artists. After his death this book was passed down to Akbar’s son Jahangir who then passed it to his son Shah Jahan from this point the book was misplaced. Eventually it was given to Frances Clark when he retired from being the commissioner of Oudh. After his death his wife sold the illustrated Akbarnama to the Victoria and Albert museum in London. The museum put the pieces on display as well as created digital copies which are open for all to access online.</p>
<p>The images displayed are illustrated pages 97 and 98 respectively. In the first image Akbar is depicted in the center leading a vast army behind him. This army is primarily comprised of individuals on horseback some of which can be identified by the flags they carry but there is also an elephant in the entourage in the top right corner. Akbar’s significance is interpreted through central placement in the painting, the individual holding a fan for shade over him and the items being given to him as tribute. Only one woman is observed in the entire image and she looks towards Akbar with admiration; whereas many of the men who are loading goods in the image are not looking at Akbar instead focusing on their work. Some of the goods depicted are huge rugs, detailed chests, drums and a boat entirely filled with elaborate pots. Additionally a palace made of while marble is depicted in the top left corner after the only line of calligraphy on the image. In the second image a battle scene is depicted, with the centralized image being three decapitated bodies. Although elephants were used in Mughal warfare, only soldiers on horseback are depicted in this image. In the corner above a river a red sandstone building is depicted, with a second more hidden domed building to its left.</p>

  <summary>Architecture</summary>
  <div>
  <p>For the major monuments of Mughal India two major materials were used for building. For earlier buildings red sandstone was used. The stone is easy to carve and transport making it a common building material. Because of these features the stone is also cheaper long term because it takes less time to get from quarry to completed engraved building. However Emperor Shah Jahan started a “marble age” due to his fondness for the material over the sandstone. Due to the hardness of the material it was heavier and harder to work with. The use of marble was seen as opulent, which is why previous rulers used it more sparingly. The white stone sticks out from the rest of the environment, making marble monuments stand out more. This may be why we immediately identify the taj mahal, but are less likely to see the tombs of other emperors with their sandstone exteriors.

  <summary>Carpets</summary>
  <div>
  <p>TCarpets were not originally made as a handicraft in Mughal India but rather it is likely that it came over with the employ of Persian artists. This caused early carpets to look more like the known Persian style. Eventually this art form evolved and flourished, being used heavily in royal courts to depict wildlife and plants. Some of these carpets also mirrored illustrated manuscripts in the way they were organized.</p>

  <summary>Rivers</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Rivers in Mughal India functioned as highways for products not only within land but also between ports and the rest of the empire. This allowed for easy transfer of handcrafted goods to meet the demands of European traders. However, during monsoon season these rivers become swift flowing and difficult to traverse, which then limits trade and movement of goods. Using these waterways was significantly more effective in non-rainy seasons, but other trails and paths were still used by those who did not have the means to travel on the rivers or when they became too dangerous. Some boats came with coverings for transporting nobles but move often they were left uncovered for carrying a large number of goods.

  <summary>Elephants in Warfare</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Elephants were used in warfare for multiple purposes by the Mughal armies. One aspect was for their ceremonial standing, they were perceived as a symbol of royalty, in addition elephants were often decorated with elaborate make up, rings, bells and necklaces. Elephants were also used to allow followers to see where their leader was because if they couldn’t find the leader it often meant that alliances were broken and individuals who were originally wiling to fight instead abandoned the mission. The high position on top of an elephant prevented this but, also left the leader vulnerable to arrows from the opposing army. Over time the position of elephants shifted from the front line of an army to break the front line of the opposing side, they later resided at the back of the army to act as a reserve as they had weapons mounted on their armor. The increase in use of gunpowder weapons eventually caused the removal of elephants from warfare.

  <summary>Rewards of battle</summary>
  <div>
  <p>War was an essential part of the structure of the Mughal Empire. Consistently being at war allowed the empire to have an increased availability of liquid assets which were used for everything from feeding soldiers to building new palaces. The repeated conquering of areas also allowed the army to gain more and more soldiers whom had already been trained and battle tested instead of depleting the ranks they already had. Additionally every time Akbar conquered more territory he gained additional political prestige; this allowed him to leverage his previous success and convince some territories to surrender instead of fighting at all.
