    <summary>Introduction</summary>
  <div>
      <p>In this image, a man named Akbar is illustrated praying on the riverbank upon receiving news from a messenger about victory in Bengal. Akbar and his men had just hoped in boats on the Indus River and departed from Fatehpur en route to pursue another campaign after defeating Daud Shah’s attempt to over throw his empire. The illustration depicts the courtier gathering and the moment where Akbar disembarks his boat to acknowledge the great victory. The Mughals invaded the Sultanate of Bengal and defeated it in 1576. This victory did not come from a single attempt; it was a result of a series of intense battles. The final battle, the one that dates this illustration was the 1576 Battle of Raj Mahal. The result of this battle was the end of the independence of Bengal, in turn; it became a Mughal province of Bengal. </p>

  <summary>Akbar</summary>
  <div>
  <p>The man found in the center of this image dressed in yellow and blue is named Abu'l-Fath Jalal-ud-din Muhammad Akbar, also known as Akbar or Akbar The Great. He was the third Mughal emperor and reigned from 1556 to 1605. “Akbar The Great came from being recognized as the Muslim conqueror of Hindu India”(Smith). He dedicated his rule to expanding and improving the political state of his empire. “He was a military innovator, a skilled diplomat and an excellent administrator of his vast empire for half a century. He was unusual for a ruler of any time or place in being eager to encourage the flourishing of a variety of religions” (Smith). Akbar is an icon for his advocacy for multiculturalism during his reign. This egalitarian outlook that he carried set him as a leader that was decades ahead of his time. “He did not judge people based on their biology and he wanted his people to have a choice in what they believed in” (Smith). The variation of skin color and different types of headdresses and turbans displays the different possible beliefs and religions expressed in the painting. Akbar was loyal to his family and a good man, “when he was urged to punish his foster (koka) Mirza ‘ Aziz: ‘there is a river of milk running between us which I cannot cross"(Schimmel). “The guests reported that Akbar handled the holy text with the deepest respect, took of his turban touched the volume to his head and then kissed it” (Schimmel). These comments from his courtier’s express exactly how religious and loyal of a man he was. Religion in his life went a bit further than his own religious beliefs, “[A]kbar, however, was himself considered to be a healer by his miraculous powers…  we learn from the sources, he cured the ailing children by looking at them or giving them water over which he breathed… He would have people believe that he performs miracles, healing the sick with the water with which he washes his feet” (Chattopadhyay). These types of miracles and inspirations express how renowned of an emperor Akbar was during his reign and explain the way in which the people are surrounding him with great space between them.

  <summary>The People Surrounding Akbar</summary>
  <div>
  <p>There are two groups of people portrayed in the image; Akbar’s men at work in the boats and the courtier who are surrounding Akbar on the riverbank. Akbar’s men appear to be busy at work as if there is not a second of relaxation to spare. Contrary to this, the courtiers all display a sense of peace.

  <summary>Animals in the Mughal Empire</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Animals were an essential part of the Mughal empire economy during the Mughal period. Animal fights were acknowledged as a form of entertainment and battle depending on the type of animal, and seen as a representation of wealth, power and prestige. They were used as tools, and slaves at the expense of their freedom. In this painting we see a live elephant and a wooden horse embellishing the bow of the boat.
Elephants were seen as a form of wealth and used by royalty within the administrative district for transport and their rulers often pitted elephants against one another for entertainment purposes. "They were are like gold and armour to the empires, something to be won, a prize of incredible value"(Rosalind). Akbar is known for his relationship with animals,“[N]izami rightly suggest that Akbar’s command of the animal as well as the human and the spiritual worlds completed the circle of his authority” (Schimmel). The elephant in this painting supports this notion; it also confirms the authority Akbar places over animals. In this particular painting, the elephant is alive but it is being used as a slave for human transport. Calvary in Bengal had a strong influence on the Mughal economy at the time. They were included in the army that was victorious in Bengal. "Horses were their primary tool, form of army and form of protection during battle"(Syed). Akbar’s boat bow depicts Calvary heads, symbolic of his readiness to fight, the army that he has and the strength his empire has in battle. Horses were not indigenous to the area. Akbar relied on import from elsewhere and victory in battle in order to acquire more Calvary. Cavalry was essential to Akbar’s success, survival and also in order to maintain a thriving political economy that he worked so hard to enrich.

  <summary>Mughal Architecture</summary>
  <div>This scene likely takes place somewhere near the Fatehpur district because we know that Akbar had just left upon receiving news about the victory. We can also draw this conclusion based on two displayed aspects in this painting. First, the unique and detailed architecture found on the building illustrated behind Akbar and the courtier. Secondly, the courtier, in other words, people who are often in attendance of royal events, appear to have gathered from somewhere near. The building resembles a sandstone palace. This is a palace that would have been found in a city home to the administrative district. “In July 1576, despite it being the height of the rainy season, Akbar decided to lead the campaign once more”. “The emperor and his reinforcements had progressed only a short distance from Fatehpur when a messenger suddenly appeared in the royal encampment, bringing the surprising news of a decisive Mughal victory.”(V&A). “This monumental complex embraces a palace, courtyards, gardens, gazebos, ceremonial gates, an artificial lake and the Jama Masjid, a mosque big enough for 10,000 worshipers. The buildings are made of the local red sandstone, and they reflect Akbar’s expansive worldview, incorporating Persian, Hindu and Muslim elements in their design and decor”(Peterson). The Fatehpur district architecture contains an “overwhelming impression of a Hindu palace, with few but some indications of Islamic design.” (Peterson). “Akbar was the greatest of the Mughal emperors—a conqueror of cities, a good-governance reformer, a patron of the arts, a Muslim who tried to engage and accommodate the Hindus and Christians in his midst. He ruled for 51 years, from 1556 to 1605, extending his domain over most of northern and central India. And he left behind Fatehpur Sikri. A connection can be made from Akbar’s Hindu background and the Hindu accents found in this area. Perhaps the city home to the administrative headquarters is one that he and his decent built.

  <summary>Conclusion</summary>
  <div>In conclusion, it is important to recognize that this illustration is just one scene out of the 3 volume series of the Akbarnama where Akbar is depicted as a monumental Emperor of the Mughal Empire. The main objective of this image was to portray Akbar’s day-to-day life of eventful reign.
