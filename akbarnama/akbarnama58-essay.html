    <summary>Introduction</summary>
  <div>
      <p>   This story is one of many from the three part series that make up the Akbarnama. The Akbarnama is considered to be an integral part of Mughal history and follows the account and the reign of the Mughal ruler, Akbar. Akbar was the third Mughal emperor who had succeeded his father, Humayan. The young emperor went on to expand and dominate the entire subcontinent of India. Written by Abu’l-Fazl who intended to portray Akbar as a successful ruler who provided the Mughal emperor with peace, solidity and glory. The Akbarnama was written during the life of Abu’l-Fazl from 1590 until Fazl’s death in 1602. During Akbar’s reign he had a deep love for arts, culture and intellectual components that he established throughout the Mughal Empire. Although Akbar was the only Mughal Emperor who was illiterate, he had a deep passion for knowledge. His passion and appreciation of different arts and cultures differ tremendously from that of his father Humayun. The Akbarnama is a product of Akbar’s love and passion for the creation of visual culture that has created a lasting impression on the history of the Mughal Empire.  </p>

  <summary>The story</summary>
  <div>
  <p>   This story from the second book of the Akbarnama is depicting the moment that Akbar crosses the Ganges as he is defeating the rebels, Ali Quli and Bahadur who are apart of Khan Zaman’s army who are crossing the Ganges. The story of this image begins further back than what is depicted in the image. It begins with Akbar and his armies journeying and closing in on Khan Zamans armies. Word has spread that they have gotten across the river that infuriates Akbar. When Akbar hears of this news, he decides to take a faster route than his army and choses to take the road alone. By the time Akbar’s armies had began their journey, nightfall closes in on them and they become lost along their route. This causes even more delay in the hope of Akbar meeting up with his armies at the forefront of the battle. Akbar makes it to the Ganges and is forced to cross the Ganges River before his armies could be there to join him. Not all rulers or heroes could cross such a dangerous and rapid river as the Ganges, only Akbar. His heroic nature and determined mindset, allowed him to have the courage to cross such a treacherous river. Akbar is represented as taking on the rebels alone, the rest of Akbar’s army who had become scattered and lost along the way, are illustrated on the banks of the river just as Akbar is entering the water. Fazl has chosen to place Akbar in the middle of the image, directing attention to him alone in the middle of the river without his men. He is riding on his trusty elephant, Udiya, who is allowing him to cross the river with great force. This image and story is illustrating Akbar as a fighter and a true successor of his Empire and his people. The bravery and strength of Akbar in this image wants to create a lasting memory and install a eternal impression on how Akbar shaped and successfully ruled the Mughal Empire.

  <summary>Elephant Warfare</summary>
  <div>
  <p>   India was the first nation to use elephants as part of their warfare tactics beginning in 1500BC. Historically elephants were used as a measuring tool to determine the king’s wealth depending on how many elephants he owned. Elephant warfare was a common use of artillery in the Mughal Empire as they were used to transport heavy weaponry and as it illustrates how they can be used as a form of transportation for soldiers and emperors. The size and force of the elephant can be used as a strategy in battles and warfare alike. Historical evidence for the use of elephants as part of warfare tactics has been related back to the Mughal Empire through many different sources of history and visual culture. In the Akbarnama, elephants are seen throughout the manuscript and appear to have a significant amount of importance for the Mughal Empire. Elephants have the ability to reach a charging force of 30 km/h which does not seem that fast; however with the circumference and weight of the elephant, it would cause a significant amount damage to other artilleries and forces. Elephants thick hide made them nearly resistant when participating in battle. Those riding the elephants had an advantage that involved the height and weight of the elephants and the hide would be fairly resistant to most strikes from the opponent’s weaponry.

  <summary>The Ganges River</summary>
  <div>
  <p>   The Ganges River is directly referenced in this story and has been known as a symbolic and important river of the Indian subcontinent for centuries. The Ganges has been a sacred and significant river for modern day Indians and for Empires that governed the land before them. The Ganges River is believed to incarnate the Goddess Ganga. Ganga is believed to have watered the gardens of heaven, however her powers were needed on Earth therefore she brought the Ganges down to Earth. Hindus believe that bathing in the river will relieve them of their sins and also be a source of Moksha. The water itself is considered to be very pure and connected with the deities. The Ganges flows through India and Bangladesh and is one of the most significant rivers in the Hindu religion. The Ganges is the longest river in India and holds much significance due to its location as being apart of the Gangetic Plain that has held a central position for successful empires such as the Mughal Empire. The Ganges holds a significant amount of spiritual power to the Hindu religion and is portrayed as such in the story of Akbar crossing the Ganges.

  <summary>Landscape and Topography</summary>
  <div>
  <p>   The Ganges River is depicted as being a plentiful aquatic environment that is thriving with abundance of natural elements. The appearance of fish, birds, healthy plants and trees that are surrounding the shores are showcasing the sacred and bountiful elements of the consecrated river. The topography of this image depicts natural elements as well as human constructed elements in the form of buildings that can be seen in the background. This adds dimensions to the image and makes it apart of a bigger picture. To showcase man made structures alludes to the fact that this battle is being fought for the Empire. This is not merely a battle in the middle of nowhere but rather is fought for the ruling territory. The murkiness of the water is caused by the where the Ganges’ water comes from. The Ganges River sources its water from the Himalayas causing it to have such a grey, murky color. The water must travel a great distance through many different river systems before it makes its way to the Bay of Bengal.
