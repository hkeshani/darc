    <summary>Introduction</summary>
  <div>
      <p>
          In class, we have discussed many of the artistic and architectural marvels that arose from the reign of the Mughal empire. At this time, through the blending of various cultures, the Mughals explored new ideas regarding art and architecture in India throughout the 16th and 17th century. A vibrant example of this is the Akbarnama, an illustrated manuscript commissioned by Akbar to document his reign as emperor, from 1556-1605. The Akbarnama was written, in Persian, by the court historian and biographer, Abu Fazl. Each folio is about 33 cm by 19 cm, and contains extremely detailed illustrations alongside Persian text. These illustrations were meticulously chosen to illustrate the art and culture of the times and to innovate new ideas within Mughal art. Through investigating the relationship between the illustrations and the translated text, we have unravelled the tale of Akbar’s reign and have gained insight into Akbar’s use of symbols and events to indicate various meanings. The Akbarnama tells many stories of passion, war, violence, loyalty and bravery, and serves as a modern lense into the struggles of Akbar and his men during his reign as emperor. In this essay, I aim to outline the happenings of the Akbarnama, folio IS.2:61-1896 in the V&A Collection1, and to investigate the intended meanings behind the illustrations and their accompanying inscriptions.

  <summary>Artist Workload</summary>
  <div>
  <p>

    Because the Akbarnama was such an extensive project that involved many artists, over a long period of time, it was necessary to have an efficient system in place to organize the workload. This was done by having small inscriptions at the bottom of the illustrations, often in  red ink. This can be seen at the bottom of IS.2:61-1896, and many other folios as well. These inscriptions have been proven to be indicative of several different pieces of information regarding each illustration. These scribes reveal information regarding the distribution of labor between artists and identify the subject of the illustration. They also indicate the amount of time needed for the production of each illustration, as well as when they were to be completed. These inscriptions are usually found on the bottom half of the page, often in red ink, but can be found in other colors too.  In the case of this folio, the notations indicate that the illustration would have been completed within 60 to 68 days (Seyller, 1987). Seyller notes these two folios as particularly masterful illustrations because the complex battle scene needed more time to be illustrated than other illustrations (1987).

  <summary>Significance of Illustrations</summary>
  <div>
  <p> Through examining the organization of materials and illustrations, art historians were able to question the selection of events that were chosen to be illustrated within the Akbarnama. Seyller (1987) also considers the validity of assuming each of the illustrations are of equal importance. This may have led to certain events in Akbar’s reign that may or may not have been illustrated, depending on how close that event was to another significant event in the story. It is therefore not a logical assumption that each illustration in the Akbarnama has equal significance.

  <summary>Folio 1</summary>
  <div>
  <p>A notable event that occurs within the manuscripts is Akbar witnessing a battle between two rival hindu groups over the proprietary rights of a tank, which was favourable for almsgiving2. This illustration is notable because the event being portrayed is spread across two full folio pages. Seyller (1987) also notes that Basavana, the designer of both folios, used the motif of human touching to make this illustration one of the most celebrated in Mughal painting from this period. This motif is most obvious in the battle scene, where there are many different people engaged in a violent battle. The two different hindu groups are visually different from each other, which acts as a contrast to each other as their bodies are overlapped in battle. Many of the warriors used various weapons in the battle, such as swords, spears, bows, shields, and daggers. The different types of clothing that the different warriors wore can be interpreted as a rich source of information regarding the daily affairs of Akbar and his men. The  author notes the use of placement and colours to represent important figures within the illustrations.

  <summary>Folio 2</summary>
  <div>
  <p>This battle continues onto the next folio (IS.2:62-1896) it the V&A collection. In this folio, various men have positioned themselves in the water next to the tree. These men appear to be washing themselves into a tank, unaware of the bloody battle that is taking place within their vicinity. The tree that the men are standing around is an obvious symbol of hope that is central to this folio. The men washing themselves at peace, next to the growing tree is a direct contrast to the bloody battle taking place beside it. The area around the tree is a very lively atmosphere with a family of goats, jumping fish, and people playing music while dancing. The platform that is built around the base of the tree is an important area dedicated to almsgiving, despite the fact that the two Hindu groups are actually fighting to keep their possession. This is a known area for people to gather and discuss local happenings and help educate others. The theme of human contact and touching is continued throughout this scene.

  <summary>Artistic Attention to Detail </summary>
  <div>
  <p>In both of these folios, there is an obvious attention to the detail of the many people in the illustration. This is one of the contributing reasons as to why these folios are some of the most celebrated illustrations from the Akbarnama. The viewer is able to distinguish the varying injuries sustained by the soldiers as well as which side they appear to be fighting for. Gonzalez takes note of the physiognomic likeness of the characters, which is due to the obvious preservation of naturalism within the illtustraions created by the artists commissioned by Akbar. This trend is clearly upheld within this illustration, as each figures face can be distinguished along with many other details of the intense battle scene.

  <summary>Conclusion</summary>
  <div>
  <p>To conclude, Akbar and his men, through sharing their brave and intense stories of leadership and battle through the creation of the Akbarnama. Without which, we would not be able to investigate the lives of members to the court and the culture that they helped create. The Akbarnama served as a stepping stone that enabled Indian art to grow to new reaches. The different artistic choices that the artist’s collectively made have given modern viewers a direct lense into the life and culture that was practiced during that time. This artistic milestone required the collaboration of many artists and was completed after seven long years, which is why these folios help to distinguish 16th century Mughal art.
