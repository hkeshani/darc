    <summary>Introduction</summary>
  <div>
      <p>Humayun the father of Akbar and the second ruler of the Mughal empire fell down the stairs to his death, leaving the succession of the empire to his son Akbar. Akbar took over the empire at a young age of about 14 years old and from there started his conquest to conquer the north part of India. Akbar was known for his military knowledge but his love for literature and books was just as known. After taking control of the north around Delhi, Akbar set his eyes on Rajasthan and eventually took it under his control. This then led to the takeover of Gujarat next because Akbar wanted to get further into the Deccan region. Akbar was also big in religion, in that he participated in a lot of faiths and their festivals even of those that were non-Muslim. Akbar set a new standard for ruling in that he assigned certain officers to certain regions and they would collect revenues and give them back to the government. This was then used to pay the military and other responsibilities. Making Akbar’s reign a very wealthy one. Akbar was one of the most successful Mughal empire leaders in India, but his death in 1606 ended his rule. </p>

They usually were heavily armoured and carried spears, swords and shield. The army was usually cut into branches each with its own officer in command that took direct instructions from Akbar. The army also had a big support system from archers that would stay in the back and shoot arrows at the incoming enemies. These mercenaries were also paid by the government for their role in the army. Akbar would fight along his men in the battles as well.

The terrain in this area can be very rough in that it is very hilly with some parts having very large hills. These hills also make it very narrow in some sections making it hard to maneuver around. The ground is covered in cacti making it harder to get through at certain parts. There are also many fortresses seen in this area that are meant to be strongholds for whomever is ruling in the area. The Mahi river also goes through Sarnal and flows to the Arabian Sea. This is where the Portuguese have setup a port which allows them easy access to India. Controlling this area favors the ruler in that it opens trade with these Portuguese and allows for a passage way to the sea.
