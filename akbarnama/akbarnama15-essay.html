    <summary>Introduction</summary>
  <div>
      <p> The Akbarnama was commissioned by Akbar himself and written by one of his closest friends, Abul-Fazl. The Akbarnama literally translates to “The Book of Akbar” and was believed to be written between 1590 and 1596, while illustrations were thought to have been composed by more than 40 artists between 1592 and 1594. There are a total of three volumes, with the first one originally written in Persian and it can be found in The Victoria and Albert Museum in the South and South East Asia Collection. The Akbarnama was purchased in 1896 from a woman named Frances Clarke.  On the outsides of paintings are red scriptures written, explaining the scene of the painting. It is said to have taken around 7 years to complete and is comprised of 116 paintings to accompany the text and illustrate Akbar’s sovereignty. This is one illustration out of the 116 and is painted beautifully in gold and watercolour on paper</p>

  <summary>The Mughals</summary>
  <div>
  <p>The Mughals were the last Islamic dynasty to rule, and are remembered as the most powerful empire. Babur, a descendent of Genghis Khan and Timur, founded the Mughal Empire in 1526. However, many associate the establishment of the Mughal Empire to be closer to 1556 when 19 year-old Akbar, Babur’s grandson, inherit the throne. The Mughals never called themselves “Mughals”, instead they saw themselves as sons of Timur, with “Indo-Timurids” being more of an accurate term. Before Akbar’s reign, The Mughal Empire focused more on the military whereas Akbar was motivated to bring peace and unite the government. With that being said, emperor Akbar was not afraid to violently defend himself either.

  <summary>Akbar the Great</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Humility, graciousness, and courage are three of many traits Akbar was recognized for. He was a man acknowledged for his strength, and “at thirteen years old he inherited the Mughal territories”  in which he was responsible for creating the successful and diverse Mughal Empire. Akbar was an emperor with strength who believed he must unite all Indians in order to create an outstanding government. He triumphantly reigned from 1556 to 1605, and during the year 1556, he victoriously defeated Panipat in his first battle. Akbar was highly known for his ability to create harmonious relationships and encouraged partnership and compatibility amongst different regions and religions. In fact, Akbar became a dominant figure culturally and economically across the entire country. </p)

</p>Although he was illiterate, the emperor held knowledge in high regard, speaking with those he believed were intellectuals capable of disseminating knowledge. His appreciation for artwork on the other hand, differed from his father’s and earlier artists who composed artwork with much more delicacy than Akbar desired. He made his expectations very clear regarding the who was chosen to compose the illustrations and requested only the most talented artists.  The Emperor expected illustrations to be composed with perfection and immaculacy in order to captivate others, however he believed the artwork was complacent with his presence included. The illustrations were created with vibrant colours as Akbar requested the works to precisely exemplify his reign over the Mughal Empire.

  <summary>The Conquering of Malwa</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Adham Khan was Akbar’s foster-brother and one of his closest assistants, next to Ataga Khan. He held the privileged position of “panj-hazārī, or commander of five-thousand troops … and was famous for his bravery and success on the battlefield.”  In this illustration by Khim Karan, he depicts Adham Khan paying homage to emperor Akbar in Sarangpur. This illustration takes place in the defeated city of Sarangpur in 1561. Following Khan’s defeat over Malwa, he acted with heinous acts of violence and slaughter against the men, women and children who resided there. After slaying Baz Bahadur, the leader of Malwa, Khan was taken aback by Bahadur’s wife Rani Roopmani, a beautiful singer, and tried to capture her for himself. However, she poisoned herself after learning of her husband’s death. When Emperor Akbar received word that such atrocities had occurred, he “resented [such] … insolence and personally marched to Sarangpur”  where he ordered that all of the stolen goods be confiscated. These are the tragic events that took place leading up to this portrait of Adham Khan and Akbar.

  <summary>A Victorious Symbol</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Pictured in the bottom left hand corner are two men who appear to be transporting a cheetah. This cheetah is displayed with its head raised towards the sky, wearing a blindfold and is restrained at the neck with a collar. Occasionally, cheetahs symbolize a “ruler’s victory … [standing] … for the sun overcoming the powers of darkness.”  The relevance of this cheetah may represent Adham Khan’s recent victory of conquering Malwa, however blindfolded as a result of the cruelty so many innocent people endured at his expense.

  <summary>Two Great Losses</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Ramadan is known as being one of the hottest times of the year in which Muslims partake in fasting from dawn until dusk. It lasts for a full month and during this time, it is expected that no one participates in activities such as consuming alcohol, sinful behaviour, or cursing. Interestingly enough, on a sweltering day during Ramadan in 1562, Adham Khan participated in at least one of these behaviours. It was “[o]n May 16, 1562 (12 Ramadan 969), a dreadful incident occurred”  involving Adham Khan and Ataga Khan. Adham Khan felt threatened and jealous of Ataga Khan’s notable superiority as he received position of minster, and as a result he decided to murder him. Khan and two others were responsible for stabbing Ataga Khan. Once word quickly spread that such a catastrophe occurred, Akbar prepared himself for confrontation. When both men met one another, Khan had the audacity to grab Akbar, in which the emperor responded with a blow to his head. The emperor then demanded Adham Khan be thrown from a balcony to his death. Surprisingly, he survived his first fall. So Akbar’s servants dragged his body up the stairs was ruthlessly thrown down yet again, this time landing on his head. Ultimately, this incident left emperor Akbar in grief without two of his closest aides and clearly stated to the public that there are stern repercussions for disobedience and unruly behaviour.
