    <summary>Introduction</summary>
  <div>
      <p>Akbar the Great reined the Mughal Empire from 1556 to 1605, during his time he wrote the story of his life referred to today as the “Akbarnama” The Akbarnama was illustrated by multiple artists from 1592 to 15941. The Miniature painting focused on in this essay is “Bairam Khan is assassinated by an Afghan at Patan” painted by Tiriyya, outlined by Tulsi. As the title implies this battle took place on Bairam Khans pilgrimage to Mecca, which he departed on at King Akbar’s request in 15611. This chaotic scene gives the impression of an epic battle. There are 30 men, 8 horses, a large tent, a fort and a boat, which together tell a descriptive story of the assassination of Bairam Khan.</p>

  <summary>Reading the Miniature</summary>
  <div>
  <p> This scene can be read generally from the top to the bottom. Starting in the top right-hand corner we see two men milling about in the fort of Patan. A man peeks out of a doorway where he is faced with a ferocious battle. Following to the left top corner we are presented with Bairam Khans camp, which is being over taken by the battling afghans. The middle of the scene is clearly defined by a split of the two slides of the battle, one third from the right-hand side is completely horse riding Afghans. This horse cavalry appears to be the back up to the next line of fighting afghans on their feet attacking the patrons of Bairam Khans party. The afghans are clearly winning the ambush as there is a pushing of soldiers and men into the left of the scene. Continuing down to the men on the boat, a man has throw his hands up in defeat as afghans board his boat. Two men on the boat turn in different directions realizing they are trapped. Finally, the pinnacle of the scene is marked by Bairam Khan, bloody and lifeless lying on the ground. The use of bright yellow robes draws the eye to our fallen hero. He is undignified in his death, symbolized by the loss of his head piece and the opening of his robes. Bairam Khans death was surprising and a tragedy.

  <summary>Bairam Khan and King Akbar</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Bairam Khan was regent to King Akbar when he ascended to the throne at only 13 years old. King Akbar had varied interests as a boy in riding, hunting, dancing and a deal of other outdoor activities all of which he was still able to enjoy even while ruling a kingdom2. This was due to Bairam Khan’s role as prime minister, during which he essentially ruled the kingdom while Akbar was developing his love for art, literature, and worldly affairs. Bairam Khan made strategic military decisions for Mughal Empire and kept other forces from overtaking the child king while he was young and impressionable2. However, as Akbar got older, he grew impatient with his old tutor, they had a falling out and Akbar sent the old man to his death by ordering his pilgrimage to Mecca in January of 1561.

  <summary>Bairam Khan and the Mughal Empire</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Bairam’s significance in the Mughal Empire started with Akbars father, King Humayan’s rein. Bairam Khan accompanied Humanyan when he was exiled in Iran. As the leader of the warfare that ensued for Humayan to regain Babur’s empire, Bairam Khans importance to the Mughal empire cannot be ignored. Through excellent military planning and strategy Humayan was able to recover almost all of his father’s empire2.  This regency was continued as Bairam Khan was appointed Akbars mentor and tutor. Without a doubt this smart, tactical and brave man was a strong influence on Akbar; from when Akbar was a small child until ruling the empire independently after Bairam Khans death.

  <summary>Battle Components of the Mughal Empire</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Instruments of Mughal warfare that are present in this illustration of the Akbarnama include longswords, shields, lances, cavalry, and Bows and arrows. Though gunpowder weapons were available in the Mughal empire at this time none are depicted in this scene. This is likely due to the small scale of this fight. Nearly all men in the battle portion of this scene are armed with longswords. Two types of shields are also present, a large full body shield wielded by a solider at the top of the scene. As well as a small defensive shield wielded by a man in the centre of the scene. It is likely that these shields were made of wood covered with leather3. The leather could have come from a variety of animals including Indian elephant, Asian water buffalo or Sambar (a type of deer)3.  In the 16th century Indian manufacturing was booming; long swords and bows are arrows were recognized by their fine Indian craftsmanship4. The archers are likely using heavy foot bows made of wood, horn and gut with draw weights of 50-100 pounds4. These bows were accurate up to 300 yards. Archers have several types of specialized arrows, including broad heads for unprotected targets, and chisel points for piercing armor4.

  <summary>Calligraphy</summary>
  <div>
  <p>This miniture painting also has red Persian calligraphy on the bottom right hand corner of the frame. This writing expresses how long it took the artists to complete the miniature. A number usually ranging from 55-68 days is indicated on most pages of this Victoria & Albert Mueseum edition of the illustrated Akbarnama5. In addition to the number of days the Iraniam months are written, which allowed for an identification for the order in which the minitures were produced. However findings from the inscriptions of the Baburnama found that the pages were completed with some overlap5. Thus, the Baburnama as well as most other Mughal manuscripts were completed in a relative but not absolute order. Conversely, this V&A edition of the akbarnama it was found that the dates are directives, not records5.
