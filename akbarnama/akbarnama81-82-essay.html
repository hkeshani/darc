    <summary>Introduction</summary>
  <div>
      <p>Emperor of the Mughal peoples at his time, Akbar was greatly concerned with maintaining a record of his legacy and his accomplishments. A common trend among past emporers was to write great diaries that would include their own accounts of accomplishment and victory for themselves and their subbordinants. The writings of Akbar's grandfather, Babur, were greatly influential within the Mughal high courts and were considered a great cultural artifact. Akbar wished to continue this tradition and produce a great work of literary art himself, however there was one significant blockade in his way. Akbar was illiterate.</p>
<p>Akbar was committed to providing not only a written record that would be perseved such as the diary of Babur, but one upon which he could reflect and receive a profound sense of satisfaction with the life, deeds, and persona he had crafted to be presented and preserved for all. To this end, Akbar comissioned that not only his diary be written by court scribes and close family, but that the diary be printed with glorious miniatures produced by prestigious illustrators and colourists from the Mughal empire and the recently conquored territories his armies had annexed. Akbar's attempts to produce a record of his legacy from which he could receive personal satisfaction and rememberance despite his illiteracy would ignite a deep tradition and historical form within the mughal empire.

  <summary>Record of Legacy</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Paramount to Akbar was that his diary, which would come to be known under the name of The Akbarnama, reflect his most grand of achievements and portray his best qualities as a ruler to his people. One such way he wished to cement this was with various depictions of events that captured him emulating the trends established by past Mughal rulers such as Babur and Timur. Many stories take place in the garden and see Akbar presiding over the construction and maintenance of these green spaces. This was a deliberate means of tying his own actions and accomplishments to those of Babur, an avid gardener who introduced the 4-quadrant garden system that would stand for so long as a centerpiece to Mughal horticulture and architecture. In addition to these cultural ties to past rulers, Akbar wished that his work in expanding the empire be captured and preserved, with many depictions of Akbar on march with members of the military or meeting with important diplomatic figures. Many stories also enforce notions that Akbar is a paragon of virtue, with courageous heart and noble valour. With the self-aggrandizing nature of the tales within the Akbarnama, scholars working on the preservation and translation of extant copies of the work have notted that the text is rife with repeating stock phrases of victory, conquest or virtue (Seyler, page 381). It is hard to imagine this would be of any bother to Akbar himself. The diary was certain to preserve a currated message of his own persona.

  <summary>A Legacy Greater Than Gold</summary>
  <div>
  <p>While the exagerated nature of these tales and their overabundance of praise for Akbar might call for questions as to how effective a ruler the man could have been, it is difficult to overestimate the growth of the Mughal empire in terms of money, territory and cultural achievements that had expanded under his rule. The Mughals continued to conquer a great number of nations and peoples and many of those people would soon produce milestone works of science, engineering and art for the Mughals, such as those who were instrumental to the production of the Akbarnama. But perhaps there is no more clear an understanding of how successful Akbar had been as ruler than in his fortune. Economic historians have poured through records of Mughal accounting and expenditure and found that not only had the wealth of the empire as a whole had grown, but the royal hoard had expanded to an amount over 7 times that which Akbar had inherited from his predicessor (Moosvi).

  <summary>Seeking a Blessing</summary>
  <div>
  <p>It is with some irony then given our modern understanding of how events would unfold and how Akbar's diary would come to be preserved for so long, that themes of legacy and insecurity run deep in his comissioned works. This story for example from the Akbarnama concerns Akbar in a state of ennui in its beginning, as he seeks out the blessing of a temple so that his life and legacy may be preserved by divine means. Travelling to Mandhakar where the temple of Kwuja-Munina-d-din was located, Akbar and party were greeted by Khandev, noble to the town and one eagre to please his guests.</p>
  <p>As Akbar saught this divine boon, those among his traveling party joined Khandev on various hunts and were entertained by such lavish forms of entertainment as elephant fights and fine wine. Khandev had greater ambitions than just the hedonistic. For as Akbar and his party were here, all able men among the village contributed to the building of fort Ajmir. It was the hope of Khandev that the village would be home not only to a great temple, but soon a great bastion of a fort as well. The well sould not be completed for some time, as even when Akbar would next return to Mandhakar following a 3 years' absence, the fort would be in the midst of tackling engineering challenges.

  <summary>The Well</summary>
  <div>
  <p>With three years further construction to the fort, Khandev was eager to host the great emperor once more. Khandev was holding a banquet among various governors, nobles, statesmen and millitary generals within fort Ajmir. Akbar and crew were very much interested in returning once more. Once they arrived, Akbar saw that while the foort stood mighty and proud, various infrastructure projects to support the well had not yet been completed. To hold drinking water, the fort would draw upon three wells dug into the ground. As Akbar witnessed these labourers before him working the ground of the village that had once shown him such blessing and generocity, he offered a blessing upon the well, proclaiming it to be now named Shukr Talao, or well of thanksgiving.

  <summary>The Party</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Not in any desire to keep those assembled waiting for him, Akbar went within the fort to talk and trade amongst the assembled figures. Within the Akbarnama, scribes are careful to record a good deal of names among the people gathered and the spaces from whence they hail. While these figures play no significant impact upon the story's events, this serves as but another reminder of Akbar's wish with this diary to preserve the grandure of his figure and his legacy. It is not long before these assembled men begin to discuss the matter of trading goods and services among one another.

</p>
  <p>These stakes are a great deal higher than any an average person is to encounter at a dinner party. It is not long before one man, Riwal Har Rai, requests from Khandev his own daughter, that she might join his harem. While Khandev was quick to accept the offer, the thought of traveling to Jaisalmir, the province over which Har Rai ruled, only to see his daughter in such a place as a harem was too much to bear upon the man. He could not bear to leave Mhandakar himself and so requested that he communicate with his daughter only by way of his own messenger.

  <summary>An Emperor's Favour</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Akbar was not one to be oblivious to the heartache the grateful man was now suffering. But he could not be so rude to Riwal Har Rai as to veto his request. And so, Akbar requested of Har Rai that concessions be made for all the workers of fort Mhandakar, that they be given permission to travel freely in and out of Jaisalmir. With such generous and hard-working men in the employ od Khandev, Akbar reasoned that the man would never go long without hearing from his daughter and that the man who had treated Akbar's party so well would have his heart warmed by such a deed that would grant such privledges to his loyal subjects. Khandev was deeply grateful to Akbar.

  <summary>The Fruits of the Blessing</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Given the preservation efforts by private collectors as well as museums such as the Victoria and Albert placed forth to study and safeguard the works Akbar comissioned, one might wager that the blessing he requested that a beautiful flower of legacy and memory bloom from the dirt of his grave has proven true. The Akbarnama and other illsutrated works he had comissioned such as the Tutinama are key features in Mughal art history. How exactly those memories have been preserved over the years has at times been contentious however.</p> 
  
  <p>When the works fell to the hands of many Western collectors in the early 20th century, many European exhibitors were quick to use the miniature works as examples of religious colonial art traditions spreading eastward and having an enlightening effect on the works and traditions of Mughal artists (Singh, page 1048). Akbarnama minituare paintings were not considered works of their own with their own legacy and context but seen in these early days only in the context of the colonial and the artworks of Europe at the time. While religious figure painting from Europe would come over time to impact Mughal miniature work, particularly in those comissioned by Akbar's successor, Jahangir, the contributions of Akbar and those he sought to preserve his legacy were largely minimilized by European scholars of the time. However in the 1930s as efforts of revolt and independence grew within then British India, Indian scholars pushed for a greater recognition of their own artistic traditions within their own contexts. Without these efforts it is difficult to imagine that we would understand Akbar, his works and his legacy so greatly as we do today.
