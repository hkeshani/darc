    <summary>Introduction</summary>
  <div>
      <p>The Mughal empire controlled a vast region of the Indian subcontinent (including most of northern India), from the early 16th century to the mid 18th century. The empire was most notable for its effective rule over India for more than two centuries. The Mughals were a muslim dynasty of Turkic- Mongol origin, with ancestry tracing back to Genghis khan and Amir Timur. The empire was founded by the Mughal empire Babur, in 1526.Baburs's grandson Akbar came to power in 1556.He is widely recognized as one of the greatest Mughal emperors to rule over the country. He is praised for his patronage for art and architecture as well as for his fair rule over muslim and non-muslim subjects.</p>
  <p>The picture illustrated here, is a page from Akbar's biography "Akbarnama" (Book of Akbar). The book chronicles the reign of Akbar, commissioned by Akbar himself and written by his court historian Abul Fazl. It consists of numerous small, yet brilliantly colored paintings that illustrate scenes from Akbar's life (includes conquests, battles, hobbies etc.) At present, the book is held at the Victoria and Albert museum in London, England. The scene depicted in the animation titled, "Akbar's adventures with the elephant Hawai" showcases an instant of elephant dueling. Akbar was said to have had a strong liking to the sport and often took part in many elephant duels. Here, Akbar is riding a wild and untamed war elephant named Hawai, while chasing another elephant by the name Ran bhaga. The scene itself is a chaotic and dangerous one. Akbar's prime minister; Ataga khan in seen praying for his safety along with the horrified onlookers. Despite the chaos Fazl mentions how Akbar manages to win the duel and safely deescalate the tense situation. </p>

  <summary>Mughal Elephants</summary>
  <div>
  <p>The Mughal's often used elephants for both war and ceremonial purposes. According to Abul Fazl, during Akbar's reign the best elephants were often acquired from Punnah in Bundelkhand. They were accepted as tribute, taken as plunder or caught in hunting expeditions. This was mainly due to the fact that breeding elephants were very costly at the time. Most elephants were primarily used for warfare. This was very evident during Akbar reign, where a remarkable revival of war elephants took place. They were specially trained to stand firm at the sight of fire as well as loud noises. The harness fitted on each elephant helped the mahout steer them in a specific direction.  Mughal war elephants were dressed in bright clothing along with bells and other accessories (this is clearly portrayed in the illustration as Hawai has a red covering on its back). Elephants in general were a very priced possession in Akbar's time (the value of a good elephant was equal to that of 500 horses). Hence acquiring a fleet of war elephants was a demanding yet beneficial task. In many instances elephants occupied a key position in the Mughal army. War elephants were an effective weapon in dominating and intimidating enemies on the battlefield.  (Gommans 121-130).

  <summary>Elephant dueling.</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Elephant dueling was an immensely popular phenomenon in Mughal courts. This was said to be a preferred past time amongst many Mughal rulers including Akbar. There are notable first-hand accounts of such duels recorded by European travelers through their encounters with the sport. Most duels were held in open courtyards with large crowds. This was often a large social event where the emperor would watch over the preceding battle. Many battles that took place in Akbar time were said to have ended with the death of numerous elephant riders. It was generally a violent event that left behind large amounts of causalities. These duels weren't just limited to elephants but other beasts as well. Both Akbar and his son Jahangir held event where animals and humans would face off against each other. This in many ways was reminiscent of gladiator battles (Edwardes and Garret 285-288).

  <summary>Mughal Architecture</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Through Akbar's promising state policies, architecture underwent a general boom in India. This was mainly due to his considerably large patronage towards architectural projects, leading to the construction of many monuments including forts, palaces, mosques, tombs etc. The fort at Agar is one such important monument built under Akbar's supervision. It commenced its construction in 1561 and concluded in1571. The Agra fort is said to be a symbol of pan-Indian secularism. According to Akbar's biographer, Agra fort was built in the "fine styles of Bengal and Gujarat". Hence incorporating the unique styles of the two regions. In the illustration, there is great emphasis on the fort at the background. It covers a significant portion of the scene. The red texture of the fort draws the attention of the viewer instantly. This in many ways showcases the architectural might of the Mughal empire. Asher also describes how Mughal building were architecturally complex and large structures that often-accompanied lavish gardens ( Asher 39-92).

  <div>
  <p>There were several water transportation modes that were utilized within the Mughal empire. The Mughal used a variety of vessels for water transportation along with unique ship building strategies. India's extensive set of rivers were often used for the movement and transportation of vast amounts of goods. Most vessels were able to accommodate large amounts of weight. The Mughals also had a freight charge system between different ports. The vessels used differed between coastal and river navigation. They were made according to the purposes such as war, carriage or swift sailing. The boat models often changed depending on the river system used (Indus, Ganges etc.). In the illustration, a significant amount of small boats are seen in the background. They may have been used for transport as well as moving goods (Mohamed 65-105).

  <summary>Ataga Khan</summary>
  <div>
  <p>The Ain I Akbar (constitution of Akbar) written by Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak is an important source for documenting the life of Ataga Khan. The book itself documents the administration within Akbar's reign. This includes administrative reports, inventory's, gazettes etc. Furthermore, it also includes court officials of the time, along with short biographies that accompany them. In the first volume of Ain I Akbar, Ataga khan is included under AIN 30: The Grandees of the Empire, section fifteen. Khan is described as a man with humble beginnings. He was born Shamsuddin, to a local farmer. In his twenties, he joined the army of Kamran Mirza. It is said that Khan saved Akbar's father; Humayun from drowning in the Ganges. As a reward, Humayun took him into his personal service while his wife became one of Akbar's foster-mothers. Shamsuddin was given the title of Ataga (foster father) Khan by Humayun. He was one of Akbar's most trusted confidants. Ataga khan was later murdered by Adham Khan (a general in Akbar's army). It is said that Akbar threw Adham Khan from the roof of a one storied building. His legs were broken in the first fall, but he survived, so Akbar ordered his soldiers to throw him for a second time. He died from his injuries. (Blochmann 321)

  <summary>Working class in Mughal India </summary>
  <div>
  <p>The Mughal society was made up of a wide variety of working class individuals that served in the Mughal courts. This included the many occupations ranging from elephant handlers, stable keepers, divers, water carriers to military and court officials. The economic conditions of most manual workers, were often poor and unequal. In the illustration, many civilians including those riding and handling elephants, workers holding fans, soldiers and court official are portrait within the landscape. This Perhaps acts as a glimpse into Mughal working class and their functions in Akbar's court. In many instances these occupations were passed on from father to son and so on. Due to this, it was difficult to change one's occupation at will. (Iftikhar 185-200)
