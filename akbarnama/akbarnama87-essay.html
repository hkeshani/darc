    <summary>Introduction</summary>
  <div>
      <p>This manuscript is the 87th folio of the Akbarnama held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, England. The image depicts the chaotic scene after Khan Kilan, an officer of the Mughal army at the time of Akbar, is attacked by a disguised Rajput. The painter, Kesav Khord, uses dozens of people as well as horses, elephants, and llamas in the image that add to the context. The people in the image are all men due to this scene depicting the Mughal army that were moving their way through India. In the background we see a city skyline with an apparent dome structure that indicates the presence of a mosque or palace. This skyline is likely either of the city of Sirohi, the city which was soon to be attacked by the Mughals, or Bhadrajan, the town that was near where the Mughals had set up their camp. The rough terrain and cliff structures in the foreground and background of the image are also indicative of the chaotic atmosphere that Kesav Khord was trying to achieve. The physical structure of the folio is well preserved as there is little wear or smudging of the paint that takes away from the painting. </p>

  <summary>Akbar and the Rajputs</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Before the Mughal conquest of Sirohi which causes the turmoil depicted in this folio was the conquering of the Fort of Ranthambhor was conquered by Akbar in 1569. This conflict helped create context for the tensions between the Rajputs and the Mughals who would later battle for Sirohi in 1572. Despite these conflicts, Akbar had Rajput lords and warriors within his noble class and worked closely with them (Talbot 331). This could be reasoning for why the Mughals were not prepared for an attack from the messenger that stabbed Khan Kilan. Seemingly there were Rajput’s who worked with Akbar, so the officers may not have seen a threat like this coming, despite the wars being fought between the two empires. 
</p>
<p>Akbar saw his relationship with the Rajput’s as beneficial to both sides. For Akbar, this relationship made him popular in the eyes of Rajput communities that he conquered, even to the point of seeing him as a reincarnation of Rama and Krishna (Zaidi 82). The inclusion of people from other Asian cultures within the Mughal nobility was also a strategic move for Akbar to hold power within his empire. This is due to the fact that Akbar succeeded Humayun only a year after his father had retaken power, leaving some uncertainty within the Mughal empire (Talbot 341). </p>

  <summary>Men in the Mughal Army</summary>
  <div>
  <p>As seen in this folio of the Akbarnama, there are no illustrated women among the Mughal army that is represented. This is indicative of Akbar’s policies when it came to choosing the people who were to serve in the army. Despite Akbar’s general inclusivity of other cultures and practices, he continued to have a policy of only Muslim and Hindu men being allowed into the imperial service (Talbot 330). At this time, women did not participate in the war effort and continued to be culturally segregated from men in public.

  <summary>Akbar's War Involvement</summary>
  <div>
  <p>After the attack on Khan Kilan, Akbar is described in the Akbarnama as taking matters into his own hands and physically joining the army in their attack on Sirohi (Abu’l Fazl 7). This, however, seems to be a relatively common occurrence within the Mughal army. After their attack on the fort of Ranthambhor just three years earlier had failed, Akbar took charge of the army himself and lead a successful siege of the fort in February of 1569 (Talbot 336). This highlights the importance of Akbar to the success of the Mughal empire at the time. His expertise for guiding an army to victory is again reinforced in the Akbarnama as he personally leads his army to a victory at Sirohi in 1572.

  <summary>Mughal War Tactics</summary>
  <div>
  <p>At the time that the attack on Khan Kilan was occurring, the Mughals were preparing to battle for the city of Sirohi. Akbar and the Mughals had defined tactics that they liked to use when attacking a city or fort, especially when they were heavily fortified with walls and supplies. Using the example of the Mughal siege of Chittaur, the Mughals built strategic passageways, called sabats, that shielded warriors from defenders as they moved upon the city (Talbot 336). These events occurred during the gunpowder age, and as such, armies were able to utilize explosives. Mines were used at Chittaur in order to destroy fortifications and gain access to the city, ultimately leading to it’s capture by the Mughals (Talbot 338). Using tactics like these, the Mughals were very successful in conquering territory and moving upon Rajput strongholds like Sirohi.

  <summary>Mughal Conquest</summary>
  <div>
  <p>The Mughals moved throughout Northern India and the Deccan conquering different areas for strategic, territorial, and political reasons. One reason why Akbar and the Mughals began to move Westward through Gujarat and Rajasthan, where Sirohi was located, was to gain access to the Indian Ocean (Alam & Subrahmanyam 360). This allowed for expansion of the Mughals into a much stronger power with access to greater opportunities. This caused further complications due to the presence of the Portuguese who had several trading outposts in the area, most notably, the region of Goa to the south. These two groups were also able to enjoy the benefits of trading with one another after the Mughals established themselves on the coast of the Indian Ocean (Alam & Subrahmanyam 361).

  <summary>Warhorses</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Throughout the folio, there are many warhorses dressed in saddles, protective covers, and bridles that served different purposes when in battle. The cavalry is a key component of this image as they add to the untamed, chaotic atmosphere that the painter was trying to achieve. Warhorses were important in Mughal military due to the obvious benefits of mobility and convenience. During tours through cities, the Mughals used these horses to display military discipline and order (Gommans 15). The presence of horses in the painting establishes the significance of military and how the situation occurring has unfolded.

  <summary>Architecture</summary>
  <div>
  <p>In the far background of the image there is a city skyline with a dome that stands out above the rest of the buildings. These types of domes were not used in Akbar’s buildings, exemplified by the city that Akbar constructed, Fatehpur Sikri (Nath 96). From this, we can discern that the city in the folio is not from Akbar’s era. It indicates that it is foreign to the Mughals, perhaps that it is the city which is going to be conquered after the events in the image transpire.
