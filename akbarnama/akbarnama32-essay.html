    <summary>Introduction</summary>
  <div>
      <p>The Mughal Empire was a great power in the early modern world. The Akbarnama (Book of Akbar) is an official chronicle of the Mughal emperor, Akbar who ruled from 1556 to 1605, written by the historian and biographer Abu'l Fazl. Akbar was fond of illustrated manuscripts and ordered artists to paint miniature paintings to accompany the Akbarnama.</p>
  <p> La’l, Makund and Naman illustrated this scene for the Akbarnama near the end of Akbar’s rule. This painting depicts the turning over of the Ajmer fort in Northwest India by Tarkhan Divana to Akbar's trusted servant Husain Quli Khan at fort Ajmer. Historically, Ajmer was a populated and a major city in the Indian state, positioned within the realms of the Ajmer District, which has significant cultural influences from Hinduism, Islamism and Jainism. When the governor of Ajmer, Mirza Husain, betrayed Akbar, he fled leaving the Ajmer fort to his deputy Tarkhan Divana. Akbar sent Husain Quli Khan to take control of the region and when he arrived at Ajmer, Tarkhan Divana, who is shown bowing, promptly submitted to the Mughal General. In the painting, Tarkhan Divana's turbaned companions appear to be confused as to why events are unfolding in the way that they are.</p>

  <summary>Calligraphy</summary>
  <div>
  <p>There is a panel of Persian calligraphy in the painting with text from the Akbarnama that reads from right to left, denoting the influence of Persian culture in this era (Soucek 171). Calligraphy is a very valued art especially in the Islamic world (Soucek 166-167). The V & A Akbarnama is part of the genre of manuscript art which originated in Persia before it was passed down during the Mughal era.

  <summary>Architecture</summary>
  <div>
  <p>In the painting the buildings are extremely fortified which denotes that this fort, Ajmer was ready for potential siege and it was technologically advanced. All the buildings inside the fort are colourful and decorated with stone intarsia, white marble and painted stucco which was frequently used during Akbar’s reign. The painting resembles the dome shaped buildings and Conical style building with large gateways and pillars. Textual evidence suggests that it might have relation to a mosque or tomb, being Gujarat-derived (Koch 75). The tombs and halls that were found in Gujarat had some of the richest developments of stucco veneer throughout imperial buildings. The reinterpretation of traditional architecture illustrates the change in conventions of Mughal building types throughout the eras (Koch 95).

  <summary>Weapons and Garments	</summary>
  <div>
  <p>The soldiers and citizens’ garments are painted bright and colourful with floral designs, similarly to that of the architecture. The soldiers who may be lower rank seem to have less remarkable garments and more simplistic weapons. The painting portrays a recognisable differentiation between social rank from the way one would dress at this ceremony and during everyday life. For example, there are tons of equipment designated for the military, ranging from bows, full armor and swords/maces where during this era they referred to daggers and swords as Jamadars and Katars (De la Garza 111). The crossbow, referred to as tufang was introduced to the Mongols during this era but they preferred the composite bow (yumi), a longbow constructed by laminated bamboo that had a significantly higher rate of fire and did not pose a challenge for nomadic horsemen (De la Garza 114). Most of the head gear used the simple conical shape while several of the gear resembles an European and Persian influence. The quilted cloth, chilta hazar masha is another form of armor which was popular in India at the time which consisted of a jacket reinforced with metal plates held together with rivets (De la Garza 111-113).

  <summary>Trade and Agriculture</summary>
  <div>
  <p>The painting displays 3 workers of Ajmer carrying textiles and produce; for instance food, wine that is stored in a clay vase, and silk for bedding (Alam 205). This symbolizes a strong utilization of agriculture and production of goods for trade within this region. The infantry and war industry was dominated by utilization of natural resources. With a strong hold on agriculture regions were able to maintain a larger population of soldiers by bringing forth a community of skilled craftsmanship, artisans and technicians for weaponry and other forms of metal work (De La Garza 108). India was sophisticated during this era in the realms of clothing, and economics, as demonstrated by their use of silk and colour in their garments and fashion. The text recounts the ancestry of the Muhgal emperors and how they traded and had agricultural productivity. For example, exports were, “fine cloth from Thanesar, silk brocade, fine calico as well as napkins and handkerchiefs from Lahore (Alam 205). There was trade as there were accounts of several Indian goods within Central Asia that stretched all the way to Gujarat (Alam 205). This source depicts some of the religious garments which were worn during this era where in the painting discusses the link with agriculture as there are several civilians holding bags of grains.
