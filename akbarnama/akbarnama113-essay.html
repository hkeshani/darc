    <summary>Introduction</summary>
  <div>
      <p> The Akbarnama is a chronicle of the reign of Akbar, the third Mughal Emperor, relaying detailed descriptions of his life and times. It contains 3 volumes and over 100 miniature paintings, representing important, archival or monumental moments.</p>
  <p>This painting from the Akbarnama, informally titled “Husain Quli Khan Jahan Paying Respects to Akbar”, is part of a double composition,  representing a time in 1572 when the governor of Lahore, Husain Quli Khan Jahan, went to see the Mughal Emperor, Akbar in Fatehpur, India. The governor, as well well as other officers of the province, gathered that day to pay homage to the emperor. Additionally, Husain Quli Khan Jahan presented prisoners from their successful battle in Gujarat, a battle which greatly situated the Mughals in an advantageous position (Pearson 61-62). The scene here depicts Husain Quli Khan Jahan paying his respects to Akbar and motioning to the prisoners, which are presented on the additional page. Akbar is seated high above the court, in an obvious position of power, witnessing the presentation, while below, the courtiers display a range of emotions as they look upon the prisoners.</p>

  <summary>Setting</summary>
  <div>
  <p>The setting, as described in the introduction, is set in Fatehpur, in a beautiful and detailed building. Large domes protrude off the page, alluding to the sheer scale and splendor. Strong color permeates around Akbar’s enclosure and dances along the walls of the structure where we find peacocks, elegantly situated near the top. Their presence, furthering our understanding of Akbar’s importance. The color and decoration outlining the building represent the architecture, as well as the painting style that dominated over Mughal India at this time.</p>

  <summary>Husain Quli Khan Jahan</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Husain Quli Khan Jahan is an important character in this scene and is represented as such in the painting. Besides being the governor of Lahore, he also acted as a strong, integral general in Akbar’s court and had much to do with the triumph over Gujarat ("Offences" 7). He stands out from crowd, as he is displayed wearing a very dark, ornate dress with a vibrant orange scarf that our eyes are immediately drawn to. He is pictured frozen in movement and speech, gazing directly up at Akbar as he presents himself and the prisoners he has brought with him. Much attention has been paid to the detail of Husain Quli Khan Jahan in this miniature which aids our understanding of his significance.</p>

  <summary>The Court</summary>
  <div>
  <p>The figures gathered below, a mixture of courtiers, officers, etc. are pictured reacting to the display of prisoners, observed on the secondary page. Their positions, gestures and facial expressions all signal something of importance happening, as they turn to each other enthusiastically exchanging words. The colors and movements of bodies located near the bottom of the page offer an interesting balance from the heavy intricacy of the building arranged more so, near the top of the page. An interesting image appears next to Husain Quli Khan Jahan, in the portrayal of smaller people motioning to an array of colorful pottery, perhaps as a gift of tribute but nonetheless an intriguing image to consider.

  <summary>Prisoners</summary>
  <div>
  <p>The prisoners, which we do not see in this particular painting, were captured during the battle of Gujarat, along with the head of Ibrahim Hussain Mirza, whom Akbar’s army was victorious over (“Offences” 7). The page describing this scene in the Akbarnama explains that the prisoners, “had fallen into [Husain’s] hands in the battle, [were] wrapped up in cowhides from which the horns had not been removed” (Fazl 93). The prisoners, as explained in the quote, were dressed in animal skins, horns and heads still attached, in an attempt to humiliate them, as well as amuse the court (De La Garza 141). The Akbarnama considers that some of the hides likely came from the 200 cows that had been slaughtered at a temple outside Nagarkot, but the painting includes the skins of other animals as well. This way of dressing the prisoners transformed them into an adaptation of human prey, appearing as none less than an animal anyone at that court could hunt and kill. Many prisoners were pardoned, with the exception of a few, as Akbar felt their true character could not be defined as they were (“Offences” 7).

  <summary>Military/Battle of Gujarat</summary>
  <div>
  <p>The military is an important part of this painting, which, as we have mentioned, contributed greatly to the situation that became the depicted scene were analyzing. The battle of Gujarat gave Akbar not only additional revenue but much power, both from the control of more land and the glory of attaining it (Pearson, 61). Akbar’s first campaign into Gujarat is said to have only taken a year and was depicted as a leisurely venture due to the well-thought-out plan that accompanied it (Zaman 313).  The campaign took after many other campaigns the Emperor had constructed, as it was common for him to create a well-formulated plan before marching into victory. This afforded him with the advantage of a clean, prepared conquest (Ibid. 313). The Emperor, as well as other rulers, held Gujarat in high esteem, as the area contained many ports that controlled trade through Western Asia and India.

  <summary>Akbar</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Akbar is an obvious, important character in this painting, as the illustration is taken from an event that took place in his life. We view Akbar here in a high position of power, seated over the display of people gathered below. His face depicting a calm and kind expression as he gazes down at Husain Quli Khan Jahan paying his respects. Pictured in a humble green shirt, a wildly intricate and elaborate blanket or tapestry cover the legs of the emperor who sits centered upon the balcony. The magnitude of Akbar’s power is illustrated through not only what I previously mentioned, but through the servants/others situated around him, fanning and offering the emperor trays with most likely drink and food items, as well as most likely being located there for assistance, advice, and anything else he may need. The representation of fine textiles and decor located all around the subject offer another portrayal of Akbar’s importance and royalty.
