    <summary>Introduction</summary>
  <div>
      <p>The Akbarnama is a series of tales explaining the life of the Mughal emperor Akbar, with particular detail given to the battles and victories of the celebrated emperor. The Akbarnama, written by Abul Fazl, are accompanied by a staggering number of paintings that provide insight to the events that occurred in Akbar’s lifetime. Notably, there are many paintings dedicated to the siege of Ranthanbhor fort, such as this one (Talbot, 335).
</p>
  <p>The painting depicts Ranthanbhor, in the upper left, as a dense collection of white stone buildings. Despite the beautiful architecture, typical of Indian design of that period, Ranthanbhor fort is in a state of chaos; women attempt to escape from crumbling walls, while soldiers prepare for battle, and to the right a number of buildings burn. Below the fort, Akbar’s army is organized behind high stone walls, suggesting military focus and superior organization. Overall, the painting evokes a dramatic sense of victory for Akbar and his troops. </p>

  <summary>Ranthanbhor Fort</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Ranthanbhor fort is noted as being one of the strongest forts in the area surrounding Agra, in a Raj. The forts is built upon a steep, rocky hill, and surrounded by a high wall, “hence they say that all other forts are naked, while this is mail-clad” (Fazl, 490). The fort was specifically important to Akbar’s campaigns against rebel groups, both for its location and its strength in withstanding attack. The Akbarnama reports that there were previously failed attempts to overtake Rai Surjan’s hold on Ranthanbhor, and now Akbar himself has come to survey the land and oversee the siege (Fazl, 491). Interestingly, the fort falls to Akbar in March of 1569, only a month after the initial siege began (Fazl, 494). 
                                      
<p> The depiction of the fort in this painting is one of contradiction: on the one hand, the architecture appears intricate and well-maintained; on the other, the walls are crumbling from cannon fire, and the right side of the fort is ablaze, smoke billowing from its towers. In much the same way, the description of Ranthanbhor in the Akbarnama and it’s defeat are contradictory; Ranthanbhor is “very lofty and strong, so that […] the catapult of the fancy [cannot] be effectual against its high walls,” yet “at every discharge [of the guns] there was a reverberation in the mountain, the ears of the solid rocks were opened, and there was a breach in the walls of the fort and the houses went to dust” (Fazl, 490, 494).

  <summary>Akbar and the Rajputs</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Rai Surjan Hada, a Rajput lord, held Ranthanbhor at the time of Akbar’s attack. The Rajputs were a warrior community who held some power in the west of India (Talbot, 330). This campaign in Ranthanbhor marks the beginning of a large-scale subjugation of the Rajputs by the Mughals. Akbar, celebrated for being religiously tolerant and including diverse peoples in his militia as well as his ruling class, made no exception to the Rajputs (Pardesi, 259). Rai Surjan, upon seeing that the defeat of Ranthanbhor was inevitable, surrendered to Akbar and sent his sons to kneel before Akbar and request him accept their surrender (Fazl, 494). Akbar accepted, and Rai Surjan and his descendants became allied with the Mughals.

  <summary>Mughal Strategy</summary>
  <div>
  <p>As this painting, among many, suggests, “Akbar was […] a great military strategist,” and had many victories (Pardesi, 259). In this painting, Akbar’s superior strategy is demonstrated in the “arranged batteries […] round the hill on the summit of which the fort was situated,” in the lower right corner (Fazl 491). The gunmen are all aligned along a tall, walled battlement, protected by shields. This allowed the gunners to continue a barrage of fire upon Ranthanbhor; Fazl describes it in the Akbarnama as an “ocean-like army” taking “the form of a devastating flood” (Fazl, 491). The cannon fire was facilitated by the building of sabats, which, by Fazl’s description, would appear to be the stone wall that the gunmen in the painting have planted their siege guns upon: “In a short space of time the work was far advanced, and the work became on a level with the fort” (494).
                                      
<p> In the lower left of the painting, one sees tents and noblemen. In Mughal India, a retinue of noblemen and advisors, sometimes even the entire court, would often accompany the emperor or commanding officers to the site of battle (Gommans, 100). While the royal camps were often located “at a strategic distance” to the actual battle grounds, the tents and noblemen are clearly featured in this painting, perhaps to draw attention to Akbar’s personal participation in this siege (Gommans, 102). The appearance of noblemen, and even a horse, may also point to Akbar’s military system, in which “nobles were paid from the central treasury and were obliged to provide troops and cavalry to the emperors in numbers corresponding to their ranks” (Pardesi, 259). This allowed Akbar to have a greater number of militiamen on his campaign, and further his victory of Ranthanbhor fort.

  <summary>Elephants</summary>
  <div>
  <p>Perhaps the most eye-catching element of this painting is the elephant, half-reared within the walls of Ranthanbhor fort. Elephants were prized possessions in Mughal India, and had immense ceremonial and propagandistic standing (Gommans, 121). This elephant is adorned with a large bell around its neck, and decorated with smaller bells along its front and sides, acting as an “exciting [wonder] of India that struck every outsider with awe, be it in processions and organised fights at court, or in the actual heat of campaigns and battle” (Gommans, 123) . 
                                      
<p> Elephants were trained to stand strong and still, even amidst artillery fire, as a symbol of strength, wealth, and military power. Unlike the prized elephants of military successes, this elephant is shown in motion, turned away from the incessant fire of cannons, half-reared on its hind legs, seeming to flee from the site of attack. This upset stoicism of the elephant suggests panic among Surjan’s troops, foreshadowing the eventual defeat of the fort. From atop the elephant’s back, “commanding generals could watch, and be watched from, the battle scene” (Gommans, 124). In this painting, a high-ranking general — perhaps even Rai Surjan himself, judging by his gold armour — views not only the Rajput troops, but also Akbar’s troops below. He has his back turned to the barrage of guns from the opposing army, and allows his elephant to flee, signalling his own realization that Ranthanbhor’s defeat is inevitable. Interestingly, there is no mention of an elephant present at Ranthanbhor in Fazl’s interpretation of the event.
