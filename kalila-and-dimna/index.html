			<h3>Who?</h3>
			In the fall of 2016, students enrolled in Dr. Hussein Keshani's course ARTH 370 - Art 7 Literature of the Islamic World at UBC Okanagan in Kelowna, Canada, were assigned the task of creating a multimedia web animation. They had to discuss an episode from Kalila and Dimna using  manuscripts held in various European museums and archives. Most had no
			knowledge of Islamic world art history or web programming!
			<h3>Kalila and Dimna</h3>		
			Kalila wa Dimna is a set of very popular tales translated and adapted into Arabic by Ibn al-Muqaffa (720-757CE). The tales originated in Ancient India, where they were written in Sanskrit and known as the Panchatantra.  The tales are allegories that address the challenges of life and rulers featuring mostly animals – the two principal characters are two jackals, cautious Kalila and mischievous Dimna.
			
			<h3>Illustrated Manuscripts</h3>			
			After the 13th century, illustrated Arabic manuscripts of the tales became popular complementing the rich oral storytelling tradition to which the tales belonged. This project includes folios from Bavarian State Library, Munich - BSB Cod. arab 616, Département des Manuscrits, BNF Paris, France - Manuscript Arabe 3467 and 3472,

				<h3>Personified Lessons for Princes (Anton Hsu)</h3>
	    		<h4>A crow made her nest near a serpent’s hole and when the crow hatched her young the serpent came and ate them. The crow spoke to her Jackal friend on what to do about the situation.

The swan took two fishes each day to the new pond but eats them on the way there. As the crab is travelling to the new pond they see these bones and decide to kill the swan. This serves as proof that a cunning person is usually demised by their own snares.</h4>

Although the lion was initially opposed to killing the camel, the crow argued that interest in the multitude should be sacrificed for the individual.

The plan went on and the entire group pretended devotion and claimed they would sacrifice themselves for the lion with the camel naively agreeing to do the same. The wolf, crow, jackal, and lion all immediately turned on the camel devouring it.</h4>
