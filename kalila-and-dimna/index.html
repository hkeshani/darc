			<h3>Who?</h3>
			In the fall of 2016, students enrolled in Dr. Hussein Keshani's course ARTH 370 - Art 7 Literature of the Islamic World at UBC Okanagan in Kelowna, Canada, were assigned the task of creating a multimedia web animation. They had to discuss an episode from Kalila and Dimna using  manuscripts held in various European museums and archives. Most had no
			knowledge of Islamic world art history or web programming!
			<h3>Kalila and Dimna</h3>		
			Kalila wa Dimna is a set of very popular tales translated and adapted into Arabic by Ibn al-Muqaffa (720-757CE). The tales originated in Ancient India, where they were written in Sanskrit and known as the Panchatantra.  The tales are allegories that address the challenges of life and rulers featuring mostly animals – the two principal characters are two jackals, cautious Kalila and mischievous Dimna.
			
			<h3>Illustrated Manuscripts</h3>			
			After the 13th century, illustrated Arabic manuscripts of the tales became popular complementing the rich oral storytelling tradition to which the tales belonged. This project includes folios from Bavarian State Library, Munich - BSB Cod. arab 616, Département des Manuscrits, BNF Paris, France - Manuscript Arabe 3467 and 3472,

The wife’s husband arrived unexpectedly and the lover could not find the well which marked as a reference point to the tunnel.

				<h3>The Human Race Compared to a Man Flying Off an Elephant (Sabrina Schoch)</h3>
	    		<h4>A man flies from a furious elephant into a well where he upholds himself by straddling serpents that are protruding into the well. He uses branches above his body to hold himself up as well, so he does not fall into the dragon’s mouth beneath him. Unfortunately, he gets distracted by the honey he sees hanging from the tree and does not realize that two rats are gnawing at the branches he is holding on to. This inconsiderateness leads him to his death.</h4>

The fox broke the object but found it to be hollow. The fox learns that sounds can be misleading. Dimna uses this as a tool to convince the lion that the sound he is hearing is not a cause for alarm but simply harmless.</h4>
